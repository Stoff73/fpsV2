## 🎯 Next Steps & Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical for Production (High Priority)

#### 1. Fix Existing Broken Unit Tests
**Status**: ⚠️ Not started
**Impact**: High - Tests must pass before deployment
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Tests to Fix**:
- `tests/Unit/Services/Coordination/ConflictResolverTest.php` (11 tests)
  - Issue: Missing `beforeEach()` setup to initialize `$this->resolver`
  - Fix: Add Pest `beforeEach()` hook to instantiate ConflictResolver

- `tests/Unit/Services/Estate/CashFlowProjectorTest.php` (1 test)
  - Issue: Missing 'income' key in result
  - Fix: Review CashFlowProjector service implementation

**Action Items**:
```bash
# Fix the tests
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/Services/Coordination/ConflictResolverTest.php
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/Services/Estate/CashFlowProjectorTest.php

# Run all unit tests to ensure nothing else is broken
./vendor/bin/pest --testsuite=Unit
```

#### 2. Security Headers Configuration
**Status**: ⚠️ Not started
**Impact**: High - Critical for production security
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

**Required Headers**:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
- Permissions-Policy

**Implementation**:
Create `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeaders.php`:
```php
public function handle($request, Closure $next)
{
    $response = $next($request);
    $response->headers->set('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
    $response->headers->set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
    $response->headers->set('Referrer-Policy', 'no-referrer-when-downgrade');
    // Add CSP and Permissions-Policy
    return $response;
}
```

Add to `app/Http/Kernel.php` in `$middleware` array.

#### 3. Authentication & Authorization Review
**Status**: ⚠️ Partial (Sanctum implemented)
**Impact**: High - Must ensure data isolation
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Review all API routes have `auth:sanctum` middleware
- [ ] Test users can only access their own data
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Test password requirements (min 8 chars)
- [ ] Test CSRF protection on all POST/PUT/DELETE requests

**Test Command**:
```bash
# Create test to verify authorization
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/Auth/
```

---

### Priority 2: Recommended Before Production (Medium Priority)

```

**Test Priority**:
1. Form validation components (PolicyForm, AccountForm, etc.)
2. Chart components (gauge charts, area charts)
3. Modal components (open/close functionality)
4. Navigation components

**Example Test Structure**:
```javascript
// tests/unit/components/Protection/PolicyForm.spec.js
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import PolicyForm from '@/components/Protection/PolicyForm.vue'

describe('PolicyForm', () => {
  it('validates required fields', async () => {
    const wrapper = mount(PolicyForm)
    // Test validation
  })
})
```

#### 5. End-to-End User Journey Tests
**Status**: ⚠️ Not started
**Impact**: Medium - Catches integration issues
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

**Tool**: Laravel Dusk or Playwright

**Priority Journeys**:
1. User registration → Login → Dashboard
2. Add policies → Run analysis → View recommendations (Protection)
3. Add accounts → Set goals → Track progress (Savings)
4. Add investments → Run Monte Carlo → View results (Investment)
5. Add pensions → Check readiness → View projections (Retirement)
6. Add assets → Calculate IHT → View net worth (Estate)
7. Generate holistic plan → Mark recommendations complete

**Setup Laravel Dusk**:
```bash
composer require --dev laravel/dusk
php artisan dusk:install
```

#### 6. API Profiling & Performance Testing
**Status**: ⚠️ Not started
**Impact**: Medium - Ensures scalability
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

**Tools**:
