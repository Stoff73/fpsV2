## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **Module Agents Integration**: CoordinatingAgent uses placeholder data. Ready to integrate with actual ProtectionAgent, SavingsAgent, InvestmentAgent, RetirementAgent, and EstateAgent when implemented.

2. **PersonalFinance Model**: CashFlowCoordinator uses placeholder surplus value (£1,000). Ready for PersonalFinance/CashFlow table integration.

3. **Feature Tests**: Infrastructure ready but pending full module implementation for realistic test scenarios.

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Task 13)

1. **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live recommendation updates
2. **AI-Powered Insights**: ML model for personalized recommendation ranking
3. **Collaborative Planning**: Multi-user accounts (user + partner)
4. **Export Functionality**: PDF export of holistic plan
5. **Email Notifications**: Reminder emails for immediate/short-term actions
6. **Progress Dashboard**: Visual progress tracking over time
7. **Goal Setting**: User-defined goals with progress tracking
8. **Advisor Mode**: Financial advisor view with client management
