## Next Steps

1. **Run Test Suite**: Execute all tests and fix any failures
   ```bash
   ./vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/Api/
   ./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/Services/
   ```

2. **Manual Testing**: Test the User Profile page in the browser
   - Navigate to `/profile` after logging in
   - Test all 6 tabs
   - Test form submissions
   - Test family member CRUD
   - Test personal accounts calculations

3. **Documentation**: Create Postman collection and update API docs

4. **Move to Phase 03**: Net Worth Dashboard (depends on Phase 02 completion)

## Notes

- All components follow the design system specified in `designStyleGuide.md`
- UK-specific validation rules implemented (phone, postcode, NI number)
- Currency formatting uses UK locale (£X,XXX.XX)
- Date formatting uses UK format (DD/MM/YYYY)
- All calculations handle null values and edge cases gracefully
- Authorization checks ensure users can only access their own data
- Ownership percentages correctly calculate user's share of joint assets

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Backend: 100% complete
- ✅ Frontend: 100% complete
- ⚠️ Testing: Created but not yet run
- ⚠️ Documentation: Pending Postman collection

**Overall Phase 02 Completion: 90%**
