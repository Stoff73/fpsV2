## Critical Requirements

### 1. Database Backup (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ THIS DEPLOYMENT MODIFIES THE DATABASE**

Create backup BEFORE starting:
- Via admin panel: https://csjones.co/tengo/admin
- OR via mysqldump: See deployment guide

### 2. Production SQL Statement (REQUIRED)

**⚠️ MUST RUN MANUALLY - NOT IN MIGRATION**

```sql
ALTER TABLE dc_pensions MODIFY COLUMN provider varchar(255) NULL;
```

**Why**: Section 13 made DC Pension provider optional in frontend/backend validation, but database schema still had NOT NULL constraint. Without this change, DC pension form submissions will fail.

**When**: Run BEFORE migration in Step 4A

### 3. Environment Variables (REQUIRED)

**⚠️ MUST UPDATE PRODUCTION .ENV**

```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://csjones.co/tengo
FRONTEND_URL=https://csjones.co/tengo
```

**Why**: Section 3 removed hardcoded CORS origins from config/cors.php. Without these environment variables, API requests will fail with CORS policy errors.

**When**: Update in Step 2 (before file upload)

## Database Changes Detail

### Change 1: Production SQL (Section 13)

**Table**: dc_pensions
**Column**: provider
**Change**: NOT NULL → NULL

**SQL**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE dc_pensions MODIFY COLUMN provider varchar(255) NULL;
```

**Reason**: Frontend and backend validation made provider optional, but database schema still required it, causing integrity constraint violations.

**Impact**: Non-destructive. Existing data remains unchanged. New records can have NULL provider.

**Verification**:
```sql
DESCRIBE dc_pensions;
-- provider column must show YES in Null column
```

### Change 2: Migration (Sections 31, 34.1)

**Table**: liabilities
**Columns Added**: ownership_type, joint_owner_id, trust_id

**Migration File**: `2025_11_22_092125_add_joint_ownership_to_liabilities_table.php`

**What it does**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE liabilities
  ADD COLUMN ownership_type ENUM('individual', 'joint', 'trust') DEFAULT 'individual',
  ADD COLUMN joint_owner_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
  ADD COLUMN trust_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
  ADD CONSTRAINT liabilities_joint_owner_id_foreign FOREIGN KEY (joint_owner_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  ADD CONSTRAINT liabilities_trust_id_foreign FOREIGN KEY (trust_id) REFERENCES trusts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

**Impact**: Non-destructive. Existing records default to 'individual' ownership. Enables joint and trust-owned liabilities matching FPS standards.

**Verification**:
```sql
DESCRIBE liabilities;
-- Should show ownership_type, joint_owner_id, trust_id columns
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I skip the production SQL statement?**
A: No. Without it, DC pension form submissions will fail with integrity constraint violations.

**Q: Can I skip updating .env?**
A: No. Without ALLOWED_ORIGINS and FRONTEND_URL, API requests will fail with CORS errors.

**Q: What if the migration fails?**
A: Check the error message. Most likely the columns already exist. Run `DESCRIBE liabilities;` to verify.

**Q: Can I deploy during business hours?**
A: Yes. Estimated downtime is <2 minutes during database changes. Schedule during low-traffic period if possible.

**Q: What if I encounter errors during deployment?**
A: Stop immediately. Check troubleshooting section in comprehensive guide. Have rollback plan ready.

**Q: How long should I monitor after deployment?**
A: Minimum 30 minutes. Watch for database errors, CORS errors, and 500 errors.
