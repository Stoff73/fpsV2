## What's New in v0.2.11

### Section 33: IHT Planning UI Enhancements (2 changes)

1. **Will Strategy Implementation Notice**
   - Component: `IHTMitigationStrategies.vue`
   - Change: Added amber warning box informing users full will functionality not yet implemented
   - Impact: Transparency - users aware of current limitations

2. **Projected Values Methodology Note**
   - Component: `IHTPlanning.vue`
   - Change: Added explanation that projected values use 4.7% growth assumption
   - Impact: User understanding of calculation methodology

### Section 34: Code Quality Improvements (7 changes)

#### HIGH Priority (2 changes)

1. **Trust Ownership for Liabilities**
   - Files: Migration + `Liability.php`
   - Change: Extended ownership_type enum from `['individual', 'joint']` to `['individual', 'joint', 'trust']`
   - Why: Consistency with Properties, Investments, Savings (all support trust ownership)
   - Impact: Enables trust-owned debt tracking

2. **Null Safety in OnboardingService**
   - File: `OnboardingService.php`
   - Change: Added defensive null checks for spouse data access
   - Why: Prevent exceptions if spouse account deleted but spouse_id remains
   - Impact: More robust error handling

#### MEDIUM Priority (2 changes)

3. **Eloquent Relationships**
   - File: `Liability.php`
   - Change: Added `jointOwner()` and `trust()` relationship methods
   - Why: Enable eager loading, prevent N+1 queries
   - Impact: Better performance when querying joint/trust liabilities

4. **Ownership Filter Logic Extraction**
   - File: `UserProfileService.php`
   - Change: Created `shouldIncludeByOwnership()` helper method
   - Why: DRY principle - eliminate 8 lines of duplicated code
   - Impact: Better maintainability

#### LOW Priority (3 changes)

5. **Improved Inline Comments**
   - File: `PortfolioOverview.vue`
   - Change: Enhanced joint investment display logic documentation
   - Why: Future developers understand storage pattern
   - Impact: Better code comprehension

6. **Centralized ISA Allowance**
   - Files: NEW `taxConfig.js` + `PortfolioOverview.vue`
   - Change: Created constants file for UK tax values
   - Why: Single source of truth, easier tax year updates
   - Impact: Follows "never hardcode tax values" principle

7. **Method Naming Consistency**
   - File: `PortfolioOverview.vue`
   - Change: Renamed `getReturnColourClass` → `getReturnColorClass`
   - Why: American spelling in code (British in UI text)
   - Impact: Consistency with coding standards

## Database Migration Details

**Migration**: `2025_11_22_092125_add_joint_ownership_to_liabilities_table.php`

**Schema Changes**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE liabilities
  ADD COLUMN ownership_type ENUM('individual', 'joint', 'trust') DEFAULT 'individual',
  ADD COLUMN joint_owner_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
  ADD COLUMN trust_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL,
  ADD FOREIGN KEY (joint_owner_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  ADD FOREIGN KEY (trust_id) REFERENCES trusts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  ADD INDEX (joint_owner_id),
  ADD INDEX (trust_id);
```

**Impact on Existing Data**:
- ✅ NO DATA LOSS - purely additive migration
- ✅ All existing records default to `ownership_type = 'individual'`
- ✅ No records modified, updated, or deleted
- ✅ Foreign keys have `ON DELETE SET NULL` (safe)

**Estimated Run Time**: 2-5 seconds (< 50 liability records in production)

**Rollback Method**: `php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1`

## Deployment Methods

### Recommended Approach (File Upload + SSH)

**Best for**: SiteGround hosting, cPanel environments

**Steps**:
1. Create database backup via admin panel
2. Upload 9 files via SFTP/File Manager
3. SSH into server
4. Run migration: `php artisan migrate --force`
5. Rebuild frontend: `npm run build`
6. Clear caches
7. Verify deployment

**Estimated Time**: 20-25 minutes

---

### Alternative Approach (Git Pull)

**Best for**: Servers with git access, automation scripts

**Steps**:
1. Create database backup
2. SSH into server
3. `git pull origin main`
4. `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader`
5. `npm ci && npm run build`
6. `php artisan migrate --force`
7. Clear caches
8. Verify deployment

**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes

**Note**: Requires git repository access on production server

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Level: LOW

**Why**:
- Migration is purely additive (no ALTER/DROP of existing columns)
- No data modification queries
- All existing records get safe default value
- Foreign keys have `ON DELETE SET NULL` (won't cascade delete)
- Code changes are isolated to specific features
- Comprehensive rollback procedures documented

### Potential Issues

**Issue**: Migration fails due to foreign key constraint
**Likelihood**: Very Low
**Mitigation**: trusts table exists in production, foreign key references valid table
**Recovery**: Rollback migration, investigate, re-run

**Issue**: Frontend build fails
**Likelihood**: Low
**Mitigation**: Local build tested successfully
**Recovery**: Re-run build, check Node.js version, reinstall dependencies

**Issue**: TAX_CONFIG import error
**Likelihood**: Very Low
**Mitigation**: New constants file explicitly documented
**Recovery**: Verify file uploaded, check path, rebuild frontend

---

- **15-30 minutes**: Periodic checks (logs every 5 min)

---

## Success Criteria

Deployment is considered **SUCCESSFUL** when:

1. ✅ Database migration shows "Ran" status
2. ✅ `liabilities` table has 3 new columns (ownership_type, joint_owner_id, trust_id)
3. ✅ All existing liabilities have `ownership_type = 'individual'`
4. ✅ Frontend build created `public/build/manifest.json`
5. ✅ Frontend assets compiled (100+ files in public/build/assets/)
6. ✅ Homepage returns HTTP 200
7. ✅ User authentication works
8. ✅ Dashboard loads without errors
9. ✅ IHT Planning projection note visible
10. ✅ Investment ISA allowance displays correctly
11. ✅ No new ERROR level messages in Laravel logs
12. ✅ Page load times < 3 seconds

**All 12 criteria must pass** before deployment is considered complete.

---

## Rollback Plan

### Scenario 1: Migration Fails (Database Unchanged)
**Action**: Fix issue, re-run migration
**Recovery Time**: < 5 minutes
**Data Loss**: None (migration didn't run)

### Scenario 2: Migration Succeeds, Application Broken
**Action**:
1. Rollback migration: `php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1`
2. Restore code files from backup
3. Rebuild frontend
4. Clear caches

**Recovery Time**: 10-15 minutes
**Data Loss**: None (rollback reverses schema changes)

### Scenario 3: Data Corruption (Unlikely)
**Action**:
1. Enable maintenance mode
2. Restore database from backup
3. Restore code files
4. Rebuild frontend
5. Disable maintenance mode

**Recovery Time**: 15-20 minutes
**Data Loss**: Any changes made after backup created
