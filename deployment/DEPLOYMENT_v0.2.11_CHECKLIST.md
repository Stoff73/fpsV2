## Step 2: Upload Migration File (2 minutes)

**File**: `database/migrations/2025_11_22_092125_add_joint_ownership_to_liabilities_table.php`

**What it does**: Adds trust ownership support to liabilities (ownership_type, joint_owner_id, trust_id)

```bash
ls -la ~/tengo-app/database/migrations/ | grep "2025_11_22"
```

```

- [ ] All backend files show today's date

---

## Step 4: Upload Frontend Files (3 minutes)

**IMPORTANT**: Must create new directory first!

### Create Constants Directory
```bash
mkdir -p ~/tengo-app/resources/js/constants
```

- [ ] Constants directory created

### Upload Files

Upload these 4 files:

1. **resources/js/constants/taxConfig.js** (NEW FILE)
   - [ ] Uploaded to new directory

2. **resources/js/components/Estate/IHTMitigationStrategies.vue**
   - [ ] Uploaded (overwrite existing)

ls -la ~/tengo-app/resources/js/components/Estate/IHTPlanning.vue
ls -la ~/tengo-app/resources/js/components/Investment/PortfolioOverview.vue
```

- [ ] All frontend files verified

---

## Step 5: Run Database Migration (3 minutes)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Verify backup exists before proceeding!

```bash
cd ~/tengo-app

# Verify backup exists
ls -lh ~/backups/backup-*.sql

# Check current migration status
php artisan migrate:status | grep "2025_11_22"

# Run migration
php artisan migrate --force
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Migrating: 2025_11_22_092125_add_joint_ownership_to_liabilities_table
Migrated:  2025_11_22_092125_add_joint_ownership_to_liabilities_table (0.15 seconds)
```

- [ ] Migration ran successfully
- [ ] No error messages displayed

**Verify Migration**:
```bash
# Check migration status
php artisan migrate:status | grep "2025_11_22"
# Expected: Ran | 2025_11_22_092125...

# Verify columns added
php artisan tinker
>>> Schema::hasColumn('liabilities', 'ownership_type');
>>> Schema::hasColumn('liabilities', 'joint_owner_id');
>>> Schema::hasColumn('liabilities', 'trust_id');
>>> exit
```

- [ ] Migration shows "Ran" status
- [ ] All three columns exist

---

## Step 6: Rebuild Frontend (4 minutes)

```bash
cd ~/tengo-app

# Clean old build
rm -rf public/build/*

# Run production build
NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✓ built in 18-25s
public/build/manifest.json created
```

**Verify Build**:
```bash
# Check manifest.json exists at correct location
ls -la public/build/manifest.json

# Count assets
ls public/build/assets/ | wc -l
# Should show: 100+
```

- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] manifest.json exists
- [ ] Assets compiled (100+ files)

---

## Step 7: Clear Caches (2 minutes)

```bash
cd ~/tengo-app

# Clear all caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear

# Rebuild production caches
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache

# Optimize
php artisan optimize

# Fix permissions
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
```

- [ ] All caches cleared
- [ ] Production caches rebuilt
- [ ] Permissions set

---

## Step 8: Post-Deployment Verification (8 minutes)

### Database Verification

```bash
# Check migration applied
php artisan migrate:status | grep "2025_11_22"

# Verify all existing liabilities defaulted to 'individual'
mysql -u [DB_USER] -p[DB_PASS] [DB_NAME] -e "
  SELECT COUNT(*) as total,
         COUNT(CASE WHEN ownership_type = 'individual' THEN 1 END) as individual
  FROM liabilities;
"
```

- [ ] Migration shows "Ran"
- [ ] All liabilities have ownership_type = 'individual'

### Application Tests

- [ ] Monitor for error patterns
- [ ] Test from different browsers

**Monitor Command**:
```bash
tail -f ~/tengo-app/storage/logs/laravel.log
```

## Rollback Procedure (if needed)

**⚠️ ONLY IF CRITICAL ISSUES**

### Rollback Migration
```bash
cd ~/tengo-app
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1
php artisan migrate:status | grep "2025_11_22"
# Should show: Pending
```

### Restore Code
```bash
backup_name="[your backup from Step 1]"
cp -r ~/backups/$backup_name/Models/* app/Models/
cp -r ~/backups/$backup_name/Services/* app/Services/
cp -r ~/backups/$backup_name/components-estate/* resources/js/components/Estate/
cp -r ~/backups/$backup_name/components-investment/* resources/js/components/Investment/
