## Pre-Deployment Checklist

**CRITICAL - Complete BEFORE starting deployment**:

- [ ] **Database Backup Created**: Via admin panel (https://csjones.co/tengo/admin) OR manual mysqldump
- [ ] **Backup Downloaded**: Stored safely locally with timestamp
- [ ] **Git Status Clean**: All changes committed on main branch
- [ ] **Local Build Test**: `npm run build` completes successfully
- [ ] **Migrations Reviewed**: Understand what migration does (adds joint ownership to liabilities)
- [ ] **Production SQL Reviewed**: Understand ALTER TABLE for dc_pensions.provider
- [ ] **SSH Access Confirmed**: Can connect to production server
- [ ] **Production .env Verified**: APP_ENV=production, APP_DEBUG=false
- [ ] **CORS Environment Variables**: ALLOWED_ORIGINS and FRONTEND_URL set correctly in production .env

---

## Step 1: Create Production Database Backup (CRITICAL - 5 minutes)

**⚠️ WARNING**: This deployment includes:
1. One database migration (liabilities table)
2. One production SQL statement (dc_pensions.provider nullable)

**A backup is MANDATORY.**

### Method 1: Admin Panel Backup (RECOMMENDED)

**Via Browser**:
```
1. Login to https://csjones.co/tengo/admin
   Credentials: admin@fps.com / admin123

2. Navigate to Admin Panel → Database Backup

3. Click "Create Backup" button

4. Wait for confirmation message "Backup created successfully"

5. Click "Download Backup" to save locally

6. Verify file exists in your Downloads folder:
   Format: backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.sql
   Example: backup-2025-11-22-150000.sql

7. Move to safe location:
   ~/Desktop/fps-backups/backup-2025-11-22-150000.sql
```

**Backup Location on Server**: `~/tengo-app/storage/app/backups/`

### Method 2: Manual Database Backup (ALTERNATIVE)

**Via SSH** (if admin panel unavailable):
```bash
ssh [username]@csjones.co -p18765

cd ~/tengo-app

# Get database credentials from .env
grep "DB_" .env

# Create backup
mysqldump -u [DB_USER] -p[DB_PASSWORD] [DB_NAME] > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup created
ls -lh backup-*.sql

# Download to local machine (from your local terminal)
scp -P 18765 [username]@csjones.co:~/tengo-app/backup-*.sql ~/Desktop/fps-backups/
```

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: Backup file exists locally and is non-zero size (should be >5MB)

---

## Step 2: Review Database Changes (5 minutes)

### Database Change 1: Migration - Add Joint Ownership to Liabilities

**File**: `database/migrations/2025_11_22_092125_add_joint_ownership_to_liabilities_table.php`

**What it does**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE liabilities
ADD COLUMN ownership_type ENUM('individual', 'joint', 'trust') DEFAULT 'individual' AFTER user_id,
ADD COLUMN joint_owner_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL AFTER ownership_type,
ADD COLUMN trust_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL AFTER joint_owner_id,
ADD CONSTRAINT liabilities_joint_owner_id_foreign FOREIGN KEY (joint_owner_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
ADD CONSTRAINT liabilities_trust_id_foreign FOREIGN KEY (trust_id) REFERENCES trusts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

**Impact**:
- Adds 3 new columns to liabilities table
- Existing records default to 'individual' ownership
- Non-destructive (no data loss)
- Adds foreign key constraints for data integrity

**Rollback**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE liabilities
DROP FOREIGN KEY liabilities_trust_id_foreign,
DROP FOREIGN KEY liabilities_joint_owner_id_foreign,
DROP COLUMN trust_id,
DROP COLUMN joint_owner_id,
DROP COLUMN ownership_type;
```

### Database Change 2: Production SQL - Make DC Pensions Provider Nullable

**⚠️ CRITICAL PRODUCTION SQL STATEMENT**

**What to run**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE dc_pensions MODIFY COLUMN provider varchar(255) NULL;
```

**Why needed**:
- Frontend validation made provider optional (Section 12)
- Database column still had NOT NULL constraint
- Without this change, form submissions fail with SQLSTATE[23000]

**Verification**:
```sql
DESCRIBE dc_pensions;
-- Check that 'provider' column shows 'YES' in the 'Null' column
```

**Expected Output**:
```
+--------------------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field                    | Type                | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+--------------------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| provider                 | varchar(255)        | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
+--------------------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
```

**Rollback** (if needed):
```sql
-- Ensure no existing NULL values first
UPDATE dc_pensions SET provider = 'Unknown' WHERE provider IS NULL;
ALTER TABLE dc_pensions MODIFY COLUMN provider varchar(255) NOT NULL;
```

---

## Step 3: Update Production .env File (3 minutes)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Section 3 requires CORS environment variables

### SSH into Production Server

```bash
ssh [username]@csjones.co -p18765

cd ~/tengo-app
```

### Backup Current .env

```bash
cp .env .env.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

### Edit .env File

```bash
nano .env
```

### Add/Update These Variables

**Find or add these lines**:
```env
# CORS Configuration (Section 3 requirement)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://csjones.co/tengo
FRONTEND_URL=https://csjones.co/tengo

# Verify these are correct for production
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://csjones.co/tengo
```

**Save and exit**: Ctrl+X, Y, Enter

### Verify .env Changes

```bash
grep "ALLOWED_ORIGINS" .env
grep "FRONTEND_URL" .env
grep "APP_ENV" .env
grep "APP_DEBUG" .env
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://csjones.co/tengo
FRONTEND_URL=https://csjones.co/tengo
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
```

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: CORS environment variables are set correctly

```

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: All 33 files uploaded successfully

---

## Step 5: Run Database Changes (5 minutes)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This step modifies the database. Ensure backup exists.

### SSH into Production Server

```bash
ssh [username]@csjones.co -p18765
cd ~/tengo-app
```

### Step 5A: Run Production SQL (DC Pensions Provider)

```bash
# Get database credentials
grep "DB_" .env

# Connect to MySQL
mysql -u [DB_USER] -p[DB_PASSWORD] [DB_NAME]
```

**In MySQL prompt**:
```sql
-- Show current schema
DESCRIBE dc_pensions;

-- Make provider nullable
ALTER TABLE dc_pensions MODIFY COLUMN provider varchar(255) NULL;

-- Verify change
DESCRIBE dc_pensions;

-- Should show 'YES' in Null column for provider field
-- Expected output:
-- | provider | varchar(255) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |

-- Exit MySQL
EXIT;
```

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: dc_pensions.provider is now nullable

### Step 5B: Run Migration (Liabilities Joint Ownership)

```bash
# Run pending migrations
php artisan migrate --force
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Running migrations.
2025_11_22_092125_add_joint_ownership_to_liabilities_table ................... DONE
```

### Verify Migration Success

```bash
# Check migration status
php artisan migrate:status

# Connect to MySQL and verify table structure
mysql -u [DB_USER] -p[DB_PASSWORD] [DB_NAME] -e "DESCRIBE liabilities;"
```

**Expected Output** (should include new columns):
```
+------------------+-------------------------------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field            | Type                                      | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |

## Step 6: Install Dependencies and Build Frontend (8 minutes)

### Ensure Composer Dependencies Up-to-Date

```bash
cd ~/tengo-app

# Install/update Composer dependencies (production only)
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

# Verify autoloader
composer dump-autoload --optimize
```

**Expected Output**: No errors, "Generating optimized autoload files"

### Build Frontend Assets

```bash
# Install npm dependencies from lock file
npm ci

# Build production assets
npm run build
```

**Expected Output**:
```
vite v5.x.x building for production...
✓ xxxx modules transformed.
dist/assets/app-xxxxx.js  xxx.xx kB │ gzip: xxx.xx kB
dist/assets/app-xxxxx.css  xxx.xx kB │ gzip: xxx.xx kB
✓ built in xxxs
```

### Verify Build Output

```bash
# Check manifest exists
ls -lh public/build/manifest.json

# Check assets directory
ls -lh public/build/assets/ | head -20
```

**Expected**: manifest.json exists, assets directory contains compiled JS/CSS files

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: Frontend assets built successfully

---

## Step 7: Clear All Caches (3 minutes)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Config cache must be rebuilt to pick up CORS changes

```bash
cd ~/tengo-app

# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear

# Rebuild production caches
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
php artisan optimize
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Configuration cache cleared successfully.
Route cache cleared successfully.
View cache cleared successfully.
Application cache cleared successfully.

Configuration cached successfully.
Routes cached successfully.
Compiled views cleared successfully.
Views cached successfully.
```

### Restart PHP-FPM and Web Server

```bash
# Find your PHP version
php -v

# Restart PHP-FPM (adjust version as needed)
sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm

# Restart Nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# Verify services running
sudo systemctl status php8.2-fpm
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

**Expected**: Both services show "active (running)" in green

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: All caches cleared, services restarted

mysql -u [DB_USER] -p[DB_PASSWORD] [DB_NAME]
```

**In MySQL**:
```sql
-- Verify dc_pensions.provider is nullable
DESCRIBE dc_pensions;
-- Expected: provider shows YES in Null column

-- Verify liabilities has new ownership columns
DESCRIBE liabilities;
-- Expected: ownership_type, joint_owner_id, trust_id columns exist

-- Check liabilities table data integrity
SELECT ownership_type, COUNT(*) FROM liabilities GROUP BY ownership_type;
-- Expected: All existing records show 'individual'

-- Exit
EXIT;
```

### 8.5 Log Review

```bash
# Check Laravel logs for errors
tail -50 ~/tengo-app/storage/logs/laravel.log

# Check Nginx error log
sudo tail -50 /var/log/nginx/error.log

sudo tail -50 /var/log/php8.2-fpm.log
```

**Expected**: No critical errors related to deployment

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: All tests pass, no errors in logs

---

## Step 9: User Communication and Monitoring (Ongoing)

### Immediate Monitoring (First 30 minutes)

**Watch Laravel logs in real-time**:
```bash
ssh [username]@csjones.co -p18765
tail -f ~/tengo-app/storage/logs/laravel.log
```

**Monitor for**:
- Database errors (especially related to dc_pensions or liabilities)
- CORS errors
- Authentication issues
- 500 errors

### User Communication

**Send deployment notification** (if applicable):
```
Subject: TenGo v0.2.12 Deployed - Security & Feature Updates

Key Updates:
✅ Enhanced security (password validation, CORS, logging)
✅ DC Pension provider field now optional
✅ State pension saving fixed
✅ Joint investment display improved
✅ Tenants in common fully supported
✅ Better ISA allowance tracking
✅ Multiple UI enhancements

All systems operational. Report any issues to [support email].
```

---

## Rollback Procedure (Emergency Only)

**⚠️ USE ONLY IF CRITICAL ISSUES DETECTED**

### Quick Rollback (Code Only - 5 minutes)

```bash
ssh [username]@csjones.co -p18765
cd ~/tengo-app

# Note current commit for investigation
git rev-parse HEAD

# Checkout previous working commit (get from git log)
git log --oneline -10
git checkout [PREVIOUS_WORKING_COMMIT]

# Reinstall dependencies
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
npm ci && npm run build

# Clear caches
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm nginx
```

### Full Rollback (Code + Database - 10 minutes)

**If migration must be rolled back**:
```bash
cd ~/tengo-app

# Rollback last migration
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1

# Verify rollback
php artisan migrate:status

# Revert dc_pensions.provider to NOT NULL (if needed)
mysql -u [DB_USER] -p[DB_PASSWORD] [DB_NAME]
```

**In MySQL**:
```sql
-- First ensure no NULL values exist
UPDATE dc_pensions SET provider = 'Unknown' WHERE provider IS NULL;

-- Make column NOT NULL again
ALTER TABLE dc_pensions MODIFY COLUMN provider varchar(255) NOT NULL;

EXIT;
```

**Then complete code rollback** (see Quick Rollback above)

### Restore from Database Backup (Last Resort - 15 minutes)

```bash
cd ~/tengo-app

# Stop application temporarily
php artisan down --message="Maintenance in progress"

# Restore database
mysql -u [DB_USER] -p[DB_PASSWORD] [DB_NAME] < storage/app/backups/backup-2025-11-22-150000.sql

# Bring application back online
php artisan up

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm nginx
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: CORS Errors After Deployment

**Symptom**: API requests fail with CORS policy error

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
cd ~/tengo-app
grep "ALLOWED_ORIGINS" .env
php artisan config:cache
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure .env has correct values
nano .env
# Set: ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://csjones.co/tengo

# Rebuild config cache
php artisan config:clear
php artisan config:cache
sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm nginx
```

### Issue: DC Pension Form Still Fails

**Symptom**: "Column 'provider' cannot be null" error

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
mysql -u [DB_USER] -p[DB_PASSWORD] [DB_NAME] -e "DESCRIBE dc_pensions;"
```

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Run the ALTER TABLE again
mysql -u [DB_USER] -p[DB_PASSWORD] [DB_NAME]
ALTER TABLE dc_pensions MODIFY COLUMN provider varchar(255) NULL;
EXIT;
```

### Issue: Migration Already Exists

**Symptom**: "Migration already exists" error

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
php artisan migrate:status
```

**Solution**: Migration already ran, no action needed. Verify columns exist:
```bash
mysql -u [DB_USER] -p[DB_PASSWORD] [DB_NAME] -e "DESCRIBE liabilities;"
```

### Issue: Assets Not Loading

**Symptom**: CSS/JS files return 404

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
ls -lh ~/tengo-app/public/build/manifest.json
ls -lh ~/tengo-app/public/build/assets/
```

**Solution**:
```bash
cd ~/tengo-app
npm run build
php artisan optimize:clear
sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm nginx
```

### Issue: White Screen / 500 Error

**Symptom**: Homepage shows blank white screen

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
tail -100 ~/tengo-app/storage/logs/laravel.log
sudo tail -100 /var/log/nginx/error.log
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear all caches
cd ~/tengo-app
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan cache:clear

# Check file permissions
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm nginx
```
