### 2. Mortgage Type Consistency Fix

**Description**: Replaced deprecated `part_and_part` mortgage type with `mixed` across the codebase.

**Background**: The `part_and_part` mortgage type was replaced by `mixed` in migration `2025_11_15_162349_remove_part_and_part_from_mortgage_type_enum.php`, but some files still referenced the old value.

**Files Changed**:

#### 2.1 MortgageController.php
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/MortgageController.php`
**Line**: 362
**Change**: Added `mixed` to `calculatePayment()` validation

```php
// Before
'mortgage_type' => 'required|in:repayment,interest_only',

// After
'mortgage_type' => 'required|in:repayment,interest_only,mixed',
```

#### 2.2 StorePropertyRequest.php
**File**: `app/Http/Requests/StorePropertyRequest.php`
**Line**: 59
**Change**: Removed `part_and_part`, kept `mixed`

```php
// Before
'mortgage_type' => ['nullable', Rule::in(['repayment', 'interest_only', 'part_and_part', 'mixed'])],

// After
'mortgage_type' => ['nullable', Rule::in(['repayment', 'interest_only', 'mixed'])],
```

#### 2.3 MortgageFactory.php
**File**: `database/factories/MortgageFactory.php`
**Line**: 19
**Change**: Added `mixed` to factory random elements

```php
// Before
$mortgageType = fake()->randomElement(['repayment', 'interest_only']);

// After
$mortgageType = fake()->randomElement(['repayment', 'interest_only', 'mixed']);
```

## Already Correct (No Changes Needed)

These files already had the correct `mixed` mortgage type:
- `app/Http/Requests/StoreMortgageRequest.php`
- `app/Http/Requests/UpdateMortgageRequest.php`
- `resources/js/components/NetWorth/Property/PropertyForm.vue`

---

### 3. Date Formatting Standardisation

**Description**: Added standardised `formatDateForInput()` helper to components with date fields to ensure HTML5 date inputs receive correctly formatted dates (yyyy-MM-dd).

**Files Changed**:

| File | Component Name | Change |
|------|----------------|--------|
| `resources/js/components/Savings/SaveAccountModal.vue` | SaveAccountModal | Added formatDateForInput method |
| `resources/js/components/Investment/GoalForm.vue` | GoalForm | Added formatDateForInput method |
| `resources/js/components/Investment/HoldingForm.vue` | HoldingForm | Added formatDateForInput in watch handler |

```javascript
formatDateForInput(date) {
  if (!date) return '';
  if (typeof date === 'string' && /^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/.test(date)) {
    return date;
  }
  const dateObj = new Date(date);
  if (isNaN(dateObj.getTime())) return '';
  const year = dateObj.getFullYear();
  const month = String(dateObj.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
  const day = String(dateObj.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
}
```

---

### 4. Currency Formatting Standardisation

**Description**: Replaced all instances of inline `toLocaleString()` currency formatting with standardised `formatCurrency()` method across Vue components.

**Pattern Applied**:
```javascript
formatCurrency(value) {
  if (value === null || value === undefined) return '£0';
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-GB', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'GBP',
    minimumFractionDigits: 0,
    maximumFractionDigits: 0,
  }).format(value);

**Description**: Updated all hardcoded tax year references from 2024/25 to 2025/26 across the application. Historical dropdown options for past tax years were intentionally retained for carry forward calculations and past ISA subscriptions.

**Files Changed (10 files)**:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `resources/js/views/Retirement/ContributionsAllowances.vue` | Updated "Key Thresholds (2024/25)" heading to 2025/26 |
| `resources/js/views/UKTaxes/UKTaxesDashboard.vue` | Updated LTA note, tax_year config, and effective dates |
| `resources/js/components/Shared/ISAAllowanceSummary.vue` | Updated heading and ISA_ALLOWANCE comment |
| `resources/js/components/Retirement/AnnualAllowanceTracker.vue` | Updated default tax year, dropdown options, carry forward years, and API call |
| `resources/js/components/Retirement/StatePensionForm.vue` | Updated full State Pension rate (£221.20/week for 2025/26) and NI gap cost note |

- State Pension: £203.85/week (2024/25) → £221.20/week (2025/26)
- CGT Annual Allowance: £12,300 (old reference) → £3,000 (2025/26)
- Tax year defaults and configs updated throughout

**Note**: The following chart components retain `toLocaleString()` in ApexCharts formatter callbacks, which is the appropriate pattern for chart library configuration:
- `AccumulationChart.vue` (chart axis/tooltip formatters)
- `DrawdownSimulator.vue` (chart axis/tooltip formatters)
- `IncomeProjectionChart.vue` (chart axis/tooltip formatters)

---

### 6. British Spelling Fix (Personalized → Personalised)

**Description**: Updated plan type labels to use British spelling as per CLAUDE.md conventions. User-facing text should use British English spelling.

**Files Changed (2 PHP services)**:

| File | Line(s) | Change |
|------|---------|--------|
| `app/Services/Protection/ComprehensiveProtectionPlanService.php` | 61 | `'Personalized'` → `'Personalised'` |
| `app/Services/Protection/ComprehensiveProtectionPlanService.php` | 440-441 | `'Personalized'` → `'Personalised'`, `'Mostly Personalized'` → `'Mostly Personalised'` |
| `app/Services/Estate/ComprehensiveEstatePlanService.php` | 130 | `'Personalized'` → `'Personalised'` |

### 7. Estate Plan Profile Section Enhancement

**Description**: Improved the "Your Profile" section in the Comprehensive Estate Plan by removing gender field and adding children/step-children display.

**Changes**:

#### 7.1 Frontend - ComprehensiveEstatePlan.vue
**File**: `resources/js/views/Estate/ComprehensiveEstatePlan.vue`
**Lines**: 209-230

**Changes Made**:
- Removed Gender field display
- Added Children display (conditional, shows comma-separated names if children exist)
- Added Step-Children display (conditional, shows comma-separated names if step-children exist)

```vue
<!-- Before -->
<div class="flex justify-between border-b pb-2">
  <span class="text-gray-600">Gender:</span>
  <span class="font-semibold text-gray-900">{{ plan.user_profile.gender }}</span>
</div>

<!-- After (Gender removed, Children/Step-Children added) -->
<div v-if="plan.user_profile.children && plan.user_profile.children.length > 0" class="flex justify-between border-b pb-2">
  <span class="text-gray-600">Children:</span>
  <span class="font-semibold text-gray-900">
    {{ plan.user_profile.children.map(c => c.name).join(', ') }}
  </span>
</div>
<div v-if="plan.user_profile.step_children && plan.user_profile.step_children.length > 0" class="flex justify-between border-b pb-2">
  <span class="text-gray-600">Step-Children:</span>
  <span class="font-semibold text-gray-900">
    {{ plan.user_profile.step_children.map(c => c.name).join(', ') }}
  </span>
</div>
```

#### 7.2 Backend - ComprehensiveEstatePlanService.php
**File**: `app/Services/Estate/ComprehensiveEstatePlanService.php`
**Method**: `buildUserProfile()`
**Lines**: 241-268

**Changes Made**:
- Added query for children (family members with `relationship = 'child'`)
- Added query for step-children (family members with `relationship = 'step_child'`)
- Added `children` and `step_children` arrays to returned profile data

```php
// New code added
$children = FamilyMember::where('user_id', $user->id)
    ->where('relationship', 'child')
    ->get()
    ->map(fn($child) => ['name' => $child->name, 'relationship' => 'Child'])
    ->values()
    ->toArray();

$stepChildren = FamilyMember::where('user_id', $user->id)
    ->where('relationship', 'step_child')
    ->get()
    ->map(fn($child) => ['name' => $child->name, 'relationship' => 'Step-Child'])
    ->values()
    ->toArray();

// Added to return array
'children' => $children,
'step_children' => $stepChildren,
```

---

### 8. Estate Plan Detailed Liabilities Display

**Description**: Added detailed liabilities breakdown to the Comprehensive Estate Plan. Previously, only the total liabilities amount was shown. Now individual liabilities (mortgages, credit cards, loans, etc.) are displayed with their names, types, and balances.

**Changes**:

#### 8.1 Backend - ComprehensiveEstatePlanService.php
**File**: `app/Services/Estate/ComprehensiveEstatePlanService.php`

**New Method Added** - `getDetailedLiabilities()`:
```php
private function getDetailedLiabilities(int $userId): array
{
    $liabilities = [];

    // Get mortgages with property addresses
    $mortgages = \App\Models\Mortgage::where('user_id', $userId)
        ->with('property:id,address_line_1')
        ->get();

    foreach ($mortgages as $mortgage) {
        $liabilities[] = [
            'type' => 'Mortgage',
            'name' => $mortgage->property?->address_line_1
                ? "Mortgage - {$mortgage->property->address_line_1}"
                : ($mortgage->lender_name ? "Mortgage - {$mortgage->lender_name}" : 'Mortgage'),
            'balance' => (float) $mortgage->outstanding_balance,
        ];
    }

    // Get other liabilities (credit cards, loans, etc.)
    $otherLiabilities = \App\Models\Estate\Liability::where('user_id', $userId)->get();

    foreach ($otherLiabilities as $liability) {
        $liabilities[] = [
            'type' => ucfirst(str_replace('_', ' ', $liability->liability_type)),
            'name' => $liability->liability_name,
            'balance' => (float) $liability->current_balance,
        ];
    }

    return $liabilities;
}
```

**Updated `buildEstateBreakdown()` method**:
- Now calls `getDetailedLiabilities()` for user, spouse, and combined sections
- Added `detailed_liabilities` array to each breakdown section

#### 8.2 Frontend - ComprehensiveEstatePlan.vue
**File**: `resources/js/views/Estate/ComprehensiveEstatePlan.vue`

**Added Liabilities Breakdown Sections** for:
- User's Estate (after detailed assets)
- Spouse's Estate (after detailed assets, if applicable)
- Combined Estate (after detailed assets, if applicable)

**UI Pattern**:
```vue
<!-- Detailed Liabilities Breakdown -->
<div v-if="plan.estate_breakdown.user.detailed_liabilities && plan.estate_breakdown.user.detailed_liabilities.length > 0" class="mt-6">
  <div class="bg-amber-100 p-3 rounded-t font-semibold text-amber-900">
    Liabilities
  </div>
  <div class="border border-amber-200 rounded-b overflow-hidden">
    <div v-for="(liability, index) in plan.estate_breakdown.user.detailed_liabilities" :key="index"
         class="flex justify-between items-center p-3 border-b last:border-b-0 hover:bg-amber-50">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3">
        <span class="text-gray-900">{{ liability.name }}</span>
        <span class="px-2 py-0.5 bg-amber-200 text-amber-800 text-xs rounded-full">
          {{ liability.type }}
        </span>
      </div>
      <span class="font-semibold text-amber-900">{{ formatCurrency(liability.balance) }}</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Liability Types Displayed**:
- Mortgage (with property address)
- Credit card
- Hire purchase
- Loan
- Personal loan
- Car loan
- Overdraft
- Other liability types

#### 8.3 Bug Fix - Spouse Data Retrieval
**File**: `app/Services/Estate/ComprehensiveEstatePlanService.php`
**Method**: `buildUserProfile()`

**Fixed**: Spouse name not displaying in Estate Plan profile section.

**Root Cause**: Code was looking for spouse in `FamilyMember` model, but spouse is stored as a `User` reference via `spouse_id`.

**Before**:
```php
$spouse = null;
if ($user->spouse_id) {
    $spouse = FamilyMember::find($user->spouse_id);
}
```

**After**:
```php
// Spouse is a User, not a FamilyMember
$spouse = $user->spouse;
```

- Now consistent with CLAUDE.md currency formatting standards

**Before**:
```javascript
const formatCurrency = (amount) => {
  if (amount === null || amount === undefined) return '£0.00';
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-GB', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'GBP',
  }).format(amount);
};
```

**After**:
```javascript
const formatCurrency = (amount) => {
  if (amount === null || amount === undefined) return '£0';
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-GB', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'GBP',
    minimumFractionDigits: 0,
    maximumFractionDigits: 0,
  }).format(amount);

### 11. Pension Detail Navigation System

**Description**: Implemented a comprehensive pension detail navigation system using component state management. When a user clicks on a pension card in the Overview tab, they now stay within the retirement module context (maintaining the top-level Net Worth navigation) and can navigate through pension-specific detail tabs.

**Architecture Approach**: Component State Navigation
- URL remains constant at `/net-worth/retirement`
- No router configuration changes required
- Instant transitions with Vue state management
- Preserves full navigation context

**Files Created (6 new components)**:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `resources/js/views/Retirement/PensionDetailView.vue` | Container component that renders pension detail panels |
| `resources/js/views/Retirement/PensionSummaryPanel.vue` | Summary view with key metrics cards |
| `resources/js/views/Retirement/PensionDetailsPanel.vue` | Full pension details (all fields, holdings, notes) |
| `resources/js/views/Retirement/PensionContributionsPanel.vue` | Contribution tracking (allowance tracker, NI credits) |
| `resources/js/views/Retirement/PensionProjectionsPanel.vue` | Growth projections, drawdown/annuity comparison |
| `resources/js/views/Retirement/PensionAnalysisPanel.vue` | Analysis with Coming Soon watermark |

**Files Modified (2 existing files)**:

#### 11.1 RetirementDashboard.vue - State Management
**File**: `resources/js/views/Retirement/RetirementDashboard.vue`

**Changes Made**:
- Added state properties: `selectedPension`, `selectedPensionType`, for tracking selected pension
- Created two tab configurations: `overviewTabs` (original tabs) and `detailTabs` (pension-specific tabs)
- Added `isDetailMode` computed property to determine current mode
- Added `currentTabs` computed property to switch between tab sets
- Added `selectPension(pension, type)` method - called when card clicked
- Added `clearSelection()` method - returns to overview mode
- Added `handleTabClick(tabId)` method - handles "All Pensions" tab click
- Updated template to conditionally render `PensionDetailView` when pension selected
- Imported and registered `PensionDetailView` component

**Detail Mode Tabs**:
- All Pensions (returns to overview)
- Summary (pension key metrics)
- Details (full pension information)
- Contributions (contribution tracking)
- Projections (growth projections)
- Analysis (with Coming Soon watermark)

#### 11.2 RetirementReadiness.vue - Event Emission
**File**: `resources/js/views/Retirement/RetirementReadiness.vue`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `emits: ['select-pension']` to component definition
- Updated `viewPension(type, id)` method to emit event instead of using `router.push()`
- Method now finds the pension object and emits it with type to parent

**Before**:
```javascript
viewPension(type, id) {
  this.$router.push(`/pension/${type}/${id}`);
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
viewPension(type, id) {
  let pension = null;
  if (type === 'dc') {
    pension = this.dcPensions.find(p => p.id === id);
  } else if (type === 'db') {
    pension = this.dbPensions.find(p => p.id === id);
  } else if (type === 'state') {
    pension = this.statePension;
  }
  if (pension) {
    this.$emit('select-pension', pension, type);
  }
}
```

**Component Features**:

#### PensionSummaryPanel.vue
- DC Pension: Current Value, Monthly Contribution, Retirement Age, Scheme Type, Provider, Lump Sum
- DB Pension: Annual Income, Payment Start Age, Lump Sum Entitlement, Scheme Type, Revaluation Rate, Employer
- State Pension: Annual Forecast, NI Qualifying Years, State Pension Age, Full Pension Rate, Percentage of Full, Deferral Option

### 17. Property Tab Inline Navigation

**Description**: Updated the Property tab in Net Worth to show property details inline (within the same tab context) rather than navigating to a separate page, ensuring the top Net Worth navigation remains visible.

#### 17.1 PropertyCard.vue - Event Emission

**File**: `resources/js/components/NetWorth/PropertyCard.vue`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `emits: ['select-property']` to component definition
- Changed `viewDetails()` from `this.$router.push()` to `this.$emit('select-property', this.property)`

**Before**:
```javascript
viewDetails() {
  this.$router.push(`/property/${this.property.id}`);
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
emits: ['select-property'],
// ...
viewDetails() {
  this.$emit('select-property', this.property);
}
```

#### 17.2 PropertyList.vue - State Management

**File**: `resources/js/components/NetWorth/PropertyList.vue`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `PropertyDetailInline` component import
- Added `selectedProperty` state for tracking selected property
- Added `selectProperty(property)` method to enter detail mode
- Added `clearSelection()` method to return to list view
- Added `handlePropertyDeleted()` method to handle property deletion
- Template now conditionally shows either `PropertyDetailInline` (when property selected) or property grid (list view)
- Updated `PropertyCard` to pass `@select-property` event handler

**New State Flow**:
1. User sees property grid (list view)
2. User clicks property card → `selectProperty(property)` called
3. `selectedProperty` set → template renders `PropertyDetailInline`
4. User clicks "Back to Properties" → `clearSelection()` called
5. `selectedProperty` cleared → template renders property grid

#### 17.3 PropertyDetailInline.vue - New Component

**File**: `resources/js/components/NetWorth/Property/PropertyDetailInline.vue` (NEW)

**Description**: A modified version of `PropertyDetail.vue` designed to be rendered inline within `PropertyList.vue` without the `AppLayout` wrapper.

**Key Differences from PropertyDetail.vue**:
- No `AppLayout` wrapper - renders directly in parent context
- Receives `propertyId` as prop instead of from `$route.params.id`
- Added "Back to Properties" button with arrow icon
- Emits `@back` event when back button clicked
- Emits `@deleted` event when property is deleted (so parent can refresh list)
- Added fadeIn animation for smooth transitions

**Props**:
- `propertyId: Number` (required) - ID of property to display

**Emits**:
- `back` - User wants to return to property list
- `deleted` - Property was successfully deleted

**Template Structure**:
```vue
<template>
  <div class="property-detail-inline">
    <!-- Back Button -->
    <button @click="$emit('back')" class="back-button mb-4">
      <svg><!-- arrow icon --></svg>
      Back to Properties
    </button>

    <!-- Same content as PropertyDetail.vue -->
    <!-- Loading, Error, Header, Metrics, Tabs, Modals -->
  </div>
</template>
```

**Benefits**:
1. Net Worth top navigation (Overview, Retirement, Property, Investments, etc.) remains visible
2. Consistent navigation experience with Retirement and Investment modules
3. No URL change required - state managed within component
4. Smooth transitions with animation

---

### Testing Checklist - Property Inline Navigation

- [ ] Property tab shows list of properties with cards
- [ ] Clicking property card shows property detail inline (not separate page)
- [ ] Net Worth top navigation tabs remain visible in detail view
- [ ] "Back to Properties" button returns to property list
- [ ] Editing property from detail view works correctly
- [ ] Deleting property returns to property list with success message
- [ ] All property detail tabs work (Overview, Mortgage, Financials, Taxes)

---

### 18. Cash Tab Inline Navigation

**Description**: Updated the Cash tab in Net Worth to show savings account details inline (within the same tab context) rather than navigating to a separate page, ensuring the top Net Worth navigation remains visible.

#### 18.1 CurrentSituation.vue - Event Emission

**File**: `resources/js/components/Savings/CurrentSituation.vue`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `emits: ['select-account']` to component definition
- Changed `viewAccountDetail(accountId)` from `this.$router.push()` to `this.$emit('select-account', account)`

**Before**:
```javascript
viewAccountDetail(accountId) {
  this.$router.push({ name: 'SavingsAccountDetail', params: { id: accountId } });
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
emits: ['select-account'],
// ...
viewAccountDetail(accountId) {
  const account = this.accounts.find(a => a.id === accountId);
  if (account) {
    this.$emit('select-account', account);
  }
}
```

#### 18.2 SavingsDashboard.vue - State Management

**File**: `resources/js/views/Savings/SavingsDashboard.vue`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `SavingsAccountDetailInline` component import
- Added `selectedAccount` state for tracking selected account
- Added `selectAccount(account)` method - uses inline view when embedded, router when standalone
- Added `clearSelection()` method to return to list view
- Added `handleAccountDeleted()` method to handle account deletion
- Template conditionally shows `SavingsAccountDetailInline` (when embedded and account selected) or normal tabs

**New State Flow (when embedded in Net Worth)**:
1. User sees Cash Overview with account cards
2. User clicks account card → `selectAccount(account)` called
3. `selectedAccount` set → template renders `SavingsAccountDetailInline`
4. User clicks "Back to Cash Overview" → `clearSelection()` called
5. `selectedAccount` cleared → template renders normal tabs

**Note**: When accessing Savings Dashboard directly (not embedded), clicking an account still uses router navigation to the existing `SavingsAccountDetail.vue` page.

#### 18.3 SavingsAccountDetailInline.vue - New Component

**File**: `resources/js/views/Savings/SavingsAccountDetailInline.vue` (NEW)

**Description**: A modified version of `SavingsAccountDetail.vue` designed to be rendered inline within `SavingsDashboard.vue` without the `AppLayout` wrapper.

**Key Differences from SavingsAccountDetail.vue**:
- No `AppLayout` wrapper - renders directly in parent context
- Receives `accountId` as prop instead of from `$route.params.id`
- Added "Back to Cash Overview" button with arrow icon
- Emits `@back` event when back button clicked
- Emits `@deleted` event when account is deleted (so parent can refresh list)
- Added fadeIn animation for smooth transitions

**Props**:
- `accountId: Number` (required) - ID of savings account to display

**Emits**:
- `back` - User wants to return to cash overview
- `deleted` - Account was successfully deleted

**Template Structure**:
```vue
<template>
  <div class="savings-account-detail-inline">
    <!-- Back Button -->
    <button @click="$emit('back')" class="back-button mb-4">
      <svg><!-- arrow icon --></svg>
      Back to Cash Overview
    </button>

    <!-- Same content as SavingsAccountDetail.vue -->
    <!-- Loading, Error, Header, Key Metrics, Account Details, Modals -->
  </div>
</template>
```

**Benefits**:
1. Net Worth top navigation (Overview, Retirement, Property, Investments, Cash, etc.) remains visible
2. Consistent navigation experience with Property and Investment modules
3. No URL change required - state managed within component
4. Smooth transitions with animation

### 20. Additional Breadcrumb Navigation Removal

**Description**: Removed remaining breadcrumb navigation from Estate Planning, Protection, and Plans modules for cleaner, consistent UI.

**Rationale**: Building on Section 12's breadcrumb removal, these additional modules had breadcrumb navigation that was redundant with the main sidebar navigation.

**Files Changed**:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `resources/js/views/Estate/EstateDashboard.vue` | Removed "Dashboard / Estate Planning" breadcrumb |
| `resources/js/views/Protection/ProtectionDashboard.vue` | Removed "Dashboard / Protection Planning" breadcrumb |
| `resources/js/views/Plans/PlansDashboard.vue` | Removed "Dashboard / Financial Plans" breadcrumb |
| `resources/js/views/Plans/InvestmentSavingsPlan.vue` | Removed "Dashboard / Plans / Investment & Savings" breadcrumb |

**Note**: The `router/index.js` file contains breadcrumb metadata in route definitions (e.g., `meta: { breadcrumb: [...] }`). This metadata was retained as it may be used for other purposes (e.g., page titles, analytics). Only the visible UI breadcrumb components were removed.

---

### Testing Checklist - Additional Breadcrumb Removal

- [ ] Estate Planning page - No breadcrumb visible at top
- [ ] Protection Planning page - No breadcrumb visible at top
- [ ] Financial Plans page - No breadcrumb visible at top
- [ ] Investment & Savings Plan page - No breadcrumb visible at top
- [ ] All navigation works via sidebar menu

### 19. Joint Expenditure Reciprocal Records Fix

**Description**: Fixed a critical bug where joint/50/50 expense sharing during onboarding only saved expenses to the primary user's account, leaving the spouse's account with no expenditure data.

**Root Cause**: In `OnboardingService.php`, the `processExpenditureInfo()` method handled **separate mode** correctly (saving different expenses to each spouse), but in **joint mode** (the default 50/50 split), it only updated the current user's record without creating a reciprocal record for the spouse.

**File Changed**: `app/Services/Onboarding/OnboardingService.php`

**Changes**:

1. Added missing expenditure fields to joint mode data array:
   - `school_lunches`
   - `school_extras`
   - `university_fees`
   - `gifts_charity`
   - `regular_savings`

2. Set `expenditure_sharing_mode = 'joint'` explicitly

3. Added reciprocal spouse update - when user has a spouse, the same expense data is now copied to both accounts

**Code Change** (lines 517-556):

```php
} else {
    // Joint mode or single user: Update user with flat data
    $expenditureData = [
        'food_groceries' => $data['food_groceries'] ?? 0,
        'transport_fuel' => $data['transport_fuel'] ?? 0,
        // ... all expenditure fields ...
        'expenditure_entry_mode' => $data['expenditure_entry_mode'] ?? 'category',
        'expenditure_sharing_mode' => 'joint',
    ];

    $user->update($expenditureData);

    // CRITICAL: For joint/50/50 mode, also update spouse with the same expenses
    // Both accounts share the same household expenses (each represents 50%)
    if ($user->spouse_id) {
        $spouse = User::find($user->spouse_id);
        if ($spouse) {
            $spouse->update($expenditureData);
        }
    }
}
```

**Behaviour Now**:
- **Joint mode (default)**: Same expenses saved to BOTH user accounts with `expenditure_sharing_mode = 'joint'`
- **Separate mode**: Different expenses saved to each user with `expenditure_sharing_mode = 'separate'`

---

### Testing Checklist - Joint Expenditure Fix

- [ ] Create new user with spouse during onboarding
- [ ] Enter expenditure with default 50/50 split (don't check "separate expenditure" box)
- [ ] Complete onboarding
- [ ] Log out and log into spouse account
- [ ] Navigate to User Profile > Expenditure tab
- [ ] Verify spouse account shows the same expenditure values as primary account
- [ ] Verify `expenditure_sharing_mode` is set to 'joint' on both accounts
