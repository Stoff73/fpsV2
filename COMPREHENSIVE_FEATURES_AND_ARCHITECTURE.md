## State Management (Vuex)

### Store Pattern

**Per-Module Structure**:
```javascript
{
  state: {
    items: [],
    loading: false,
    error: null,
    selectedId: null
  },
  
  mutations: {
    setLoading(state, loading) { ... },
    setError(state, error) { ... },
    setItems(state, items) { ... }
  },
  
  actions: {
    async fetchItems({ commit }) { ... },
    async createItem({ commit }, data) { ... },
    async updateItem({ commit }, data) { ... }
  },
  
  getters: {
    items: state => state.items,
    totalValue: state => state.items.reduce(...),
    isLoading: state => state.loading
  }
}
```

### Form Modal Pattern

**Unified Form Components** (Critical Rule):
- Single form component used across onboarding, dashboard, and editing
- Accepts `item` and `isEditing` props
- Emits `@save` and `@close` events (NOT `@submit` - causes double submission)
- Parent component handles create vs. update logic

**Example Usage**:
```vue
<PolicyForm
  v-if="showForm"
  :policy="editingPolicy"
  :is-editing="!!editingPolicy"
  @save="handleSave"
  @close="showForm = false"
/>
```

---

## Testing & Quality

### Test Suite

**Pest PHP Framework** (60+ tests):
- Unit tests for services and calculations
- Feature tests for API endpoints
- Architecture tests for code standards

**Test Categories**:
- **Unit Tests** (36+): Individual service calculations
  - MonteCarloSimulatorTest
  - AdequacyScorerTest
  - CoverageGapAnalyzerTest
  - IHTCalculatorTest
  - TaxConfigServiceTest
  - etc.

- **Feature Tests**: API endpoint integration
  - Authentication flow
  - CRUD operations
  - Cross-module workflows

- **Architecture Tests** (24): Code quality enforcement
  - All agents extend BaseAgent
  - All controllers extend Controller
  - All form requests extend FormRequest
  - Models use HasFactory trait
  - Services use strict typing
  - No raw DB queries in controllers

### Code Quality

- **Laravel Pint**: PSR-12 compliance checking
- **Type Safety**: Strict types declared in all files
- **Testing**: 100% passing rate
- **Architecture**: Automated architecture rule enforcement

---

## Tax Configuration System

### Database-Driven Configuration

**Active Tax Year**: 2025/26 (configurable)

**Stored Tax Values**:
- Income tax bands and rates
- National Insurance thresholds and rates
- ISA allowances (£20,000 per annum)
- Pension annual allowance (£60,000 + taper)
- Dividend tax rates and allowances
- Capital Gains Tax rates and exemptions
- IHT rates, NRB (£325k), RNRB (£175k)
- Stamp Duty Land Tax bands
- PET/CLT gifting rules and exemptions

**Access Pattern**:
```php
use App\Services\TaxConfigService;

class MyService {
    public function __construct(private TaxConfigService $taxConfig) {}
    
    public function calculate() {
        $incomeTax = $this->taxConfig->getIncomeTax();
        $personalAllowance = $incomeTax['personal_allowance'];
    }
}
```

**Admin Updates**:
1. Select tax year in admin panel
2. Edit all tax values
3. Activate new year (auto-deactivates previous)
4. Effective date tracking for period changes

---

## Caching Strategy

### Cache Layers

**Cache TTLs**:
- **Tax Config**: 1 hour (changes infrequently)
- **Monte Carlo Results**: 24 hours (expensive calculation)
- **Dashboard Data**: 30 minutes (frequently accessed)
- **Agent Analysis**: 1 hour (module-level insights)
- **Holistic Plan**: 24 hours (expensive cross-module)

### Cache Invalidation

**Automatic Invalidation** on:
- Data creation (new policy, account, etc.)
- Data updates (modify holdings, income, etc.)
- Data deletion (remove account, policy, etc.)

**Manual Cache Clearing**:
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

---

- **Pagination**: Large result sets paginated

### API
- **Throttling**: Rate limiting per endpoint
- **Validation**: Server-side validation on all inputs
- **Response Compression**: Gzip enabled
- **Lazy Loading**: Vue components loaded on demand

---

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Setup
- Separate `.env` for development vs. production
- Never commit `.env.production` with real values
- Use `.env.production.example` as template

### Database
- **Migrations**: Forward-only (no rollback in production)
- **Backups**: Required before any schema changes
- **Seeding**: Tax configuration must be seeded
- **Admin Account**: `admin@fps.com` / `admin123`

### Server Requirements
- PHP 8.2+ with BCMath, Ctype, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, Tokenizer, XML
- MySQL 8.0+ with InnoDB
- Memcached 1.6+
- Nginx or Apache with mod_rewrite
- SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt recommended)

### Queue Workers
- Supervisor configuration required for queue:work
- At least 2 workers for reliability
- Monitoring/alerting on failure
