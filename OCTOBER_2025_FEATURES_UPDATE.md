### 7. Will Planning & Estate Distribution

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: October 21, 2025

#### Features:
- **Death Scenario Planning**: Choose between two scenarios:
  1. User death only (spouse survives) - Spouse exemption applies
  2. Both dying simultaneously - No spouse exemption, full IHT calculation

- **Spouse Bequest Configuration**:
  - Toggle spouse as primary beneficiary
  - Slider to set percentage (0-100%) of estate to spouse
  - Real-time calculation of amounts:
    - Amount to spouse (tax-free via spouse exemption)
    - Amount to other beneficiaries (subject to IHT)

- **Specific Bequests Management**:
  - Add/edit/delete specific bequests to beneficiaries
  - Bequest types:
    - **Percentage of estate**: Specify % of total estate
    - **Specific amount**: Fixed monetary amount
    - **Specific asset**: Named asset with description
    - **Residuary**: Remainder of estate after other bequests
  - Conditional bequests with notes
  - Priority ordering for bequest distribution

- **Executor Notes**: Optional field for special instructions to executors

    - `user_id`, `death_scenario`, `spouse_primary_beneficiary`
    - `spouse_bequest_percentage`, `executor_notes`
  - `Bequest` model with fields:

- **Database Migration**: `2025_10_21_162955_create_wills_and_bequests_tables.php`

- **API Endpoints** (EstateController):
  ```
  GET    /api/estate/will              # Get user's will configuration
  POST   /api/estate/will              # Create/update will
  GET    /api/estate/bequests          # List all bequests
  POST   /api/estate/bequests          # Create bequest
  PUT    /api/estate/bequests/{id}     # Update bequest
  DELETE /api/estate/bequests/{id}     # Delete bequest
  ```

- **Frontend Component**: `WillPlanning.vue`
  - Integrated into Estate Dashboard as new tab
  - Real-time estate value integration from IHT calculator
  - Visual feedback for tax implications
  - Marital status awareness (shows spouse options only if married)

#### Business Logic:
- **User Death Only Scenario**:

    - Remaining estate distributed per bequests, subject to IHT
  - If spouse is NOT primary beneficiary:
    - Entire estate subject to IHT calculation
    - Warning displayed to user

- **Both Dying Simultaneously**:
  - Spouse exemption does NOT apply
  - Full estate value subject to IHT
  - Distribution per bequests to other beneficiaries

#### Integration:
- Links to IHT calculation for net estate value
- Considers death scenario in IHT planning recommendations
- Provides probate readiness insights

### 8. Enhanced Protection Analysis with UK Tax Calculations

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: October 21, 2025

#### Features:
- **UK Tax Calculator Service** (NEW):
  - Centralized service for income tax and National Insurance calculations
  - Uses 2025/26 tax year rates (personal allowance, basic/higher/additional rate bands)
  - Calculates Class 1 NI (employees) and Class 4 NI (self-employed)
  - Supports multiple income types: employment, self-employment, rental, dividend, other
  - Returns detailed breakdown: gross income, tax, NI, net income, effective tax rate

- **Enhanced Coverage Gap Analyzer**:
  - Uses NET income (after tax and NI) for human capital calculation
  - Pulls debt from actual mortgages and liabilities tables (real-time data)
  - Tracks spouse income separately with permission checks
  - Spouse income REDUCES protection need (continues after user's death)
  - Excludes rental/dividend income from protection needs (continues after death)
  - Income categorization:
    - **Earned Income** (STOPS on death): Employment, self-employment
    - **Continuing Income** (CONTINUES after death): Rental, dividend
  - Enhanced income breakdown tracking (gross, net, continuing, spouse)

- **Protection Agent Updates**:
  - Integrate UKTaxCalculator for accurate net income calculations
  - Pass spouse income data to gap analyzer
  - Enhanced analysis response with spouse income details
  - Cache invalidation when income changes (user and spouse)

- **Gap Analysis UI Enhancements**:
  - "No Policies" alert banner (non-blocking, shows needs calculation)
  - "Spouse Income Not Included" warning when permission denied
  - Comprehensive Protection Needs Breakdown section
  - Income Source Breakdown table with collapsible spouse details
  - Tax & Deductions Breakdown section
  - Spouse permission status and data sharing info
  - Enhanced tooltips and explanations

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Service**: `app/Services/UKTaxCalculator.php` (NEW)
- **Modified Services**:
  - `app/Services/Protection/CoverageGapAnalyzer.php`
  - `app/Agents/ProtectionAgent.php`
- **Modified Controllers**:
  - `app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserProfileController.php` (cache invalidation)
- **Modified Components**:
  - `resources/js/components/Protection/GapAnalysis.vue` (major UI update)
  - `resources/js/components/Protection/CurrentSituation.vue`
  - `resources/js/components/Protection/CoverageGapChart.vue`
  - `resources/js/store/modules/protection.js`

#### Business Logic:
**Income Type Categorization**:
1. **Earned Income** (STOPS on death):
   - Employment income (PAYE)
   - Self-employment income
   - Other earned income

2. **Continuing Income** (CONTINUES after death):
   - Rental income (property continues to generate)
   - Dividend income (investments continue)

**Spouse Income Impact**:
- If spouse permission GRANTED: Include spouse income (REDUCES protection need)
- If spouse permission DENIED: Show warning, exclude spouse income (INCREASES protection need)
- Spouse income continues after user's death, reducing family's income replacement need

**Protection Need Formula**:
```
Protection Need = (User Net Earned Income × Multiplier)
                  + Debts (mortgages + liabilities)
                  - Spouse Net Income (if permission granted)
                  - Continuing Income (rental + dividend)
```

**Cache Strategy**:
- Clear protection cache when user updates income
- Clear spouse's protection cache when linked user updates income
- Ensures real-time recalculation of protection needs

- **Future Value Projections**: Projects all assets to expected death date using asset-specific growth rates
- **Comprehensive IHT Calculation**: Calculates IHT liability as a surviving spouse with full NRB transfer
- **Interactive UI**: Beautiful Vue component showing current vs. projected estate values and IHT liability

#### Technical Implementation:

**Database**:
- Migration: `2025_10_21_172331_create_uk_life_expectancy_tables_table.php`
- Seeder: `UKLifeExpectancySeeder.php` - ONS life expectancy data for ages 0-100, male/female
- Table structure: age, gender, life_expectancy_years, table_version, data_year

**Backend Services**:
1. **ActuarialLifeTableService** (`app/Services/Estate/ActuarialLifeTableService.php`):
   - Get life expectancy for any age/gender
   - Calculate estimated age at death
   - Perform surviving spouse analysis
   - Interpolate data for ages not in table

2. **SpouseNRBTrackerService** (`app/Services/Estate/SpouseNRBTrackerService.php`):
   - Track deceased spouse's NRB usage (gifts within 7 years)
   - Calculate transferable NRB amount (£0-£325k based on usage)
   - Check for full NRB transfer eligibility (double NRB = £650k if spouse used £0)
   - Calculate RNRB transfer details

3. **FutureValueCalculator** (`app/Services/Estate/FutureValueCalculator.php`):
   - Project asset values using compound growth
   - Support different growth rates by asset type:
     - Property: 3% per annum
     - Investments: 5% per annum
     - Cash/Savings: 4% per annum
     - Pensions: 5% per annum
   - Calculate real future value (inflation-adjusted)
   - Project entire estate portfolio to death date

4. **Enhanced IHTCalculator**:
   - New method: `calculateSurvivingSpouseIHT()`
   - Integrates actuarial, NRB tracking, and future value services
   - Returns comprehensive analysis with projected IHT liability

**API Endpoint**:

- Controller: `EstateController@calculateSurvivingSpouseIHT`
- Validation:
  - User must be married or widowed
  - Must have linked spouse account
  - Must have date_of_birth and gender set

- Total: 15 new tests with 63 assertions, all passing

#### Use Case Example:
1. User (male, age 49) logs in as surviving spouse
2. System calculates life expectancy: ~30 years (dies at age 79 in 2054)
3. Checks deceased spouse's NRB usage: £0 used on gifts
4. Transferable NRB: Full £325k (total available NRB = £650k)
5. Projects current estate of £800k to £1.3M at death (growth over 30 years)
6. Calculates IHT: (£1.3M - £650k NRB - £175k RNRB) × 40% = £190k IHT liability
7. User sees full breakdown and can plan accordingly

#### Key Benefits:
- **Actuarially accurate** using real UK ONS data
- **Automatic NRB tracking** - no manual calculation needed
- **Future value projections** - realistic growth assumptions
- **Comprehensive analysis** - full IHT breakdown
- **User-friendly** - complex calculations presented clearly
