#### Technical Implementation:

### 7. Will Planning & Estate Distribution

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: October 21, 2025

#### Features:
- **Death Scenario Planning**: Choose between two scenarios:
  1. User death only (spouse survives) - Spouse exemption applies
  2. Both dying simultaneously - No spouse exemption, full IHT calculation

- **Spouse Bequest Configuration**:
  - Toggle spouse as primary beneficiary
  - Slider to set percentage (0-100%) of estate to spouse
  - Real-time calculation of amounts:
    - Amount to spouse (tax-free via spouse exemption)
    - Amount to other beneficiaries (subject to IHT)

- **Specific Bequests Management**:
  - Add/edit/delete specific bequests to beneficiaries
  - Bequest types:
    - **Percentage of estate**: Specify % of total estate
    - **Specific amount**: Fixed monetary amount
    - **Specific asset**: Named asset with description
    - **Residuary**: Remainder of estate after other bequests
  - Conditional bequests with notes
  - Priority ordering for bequest distribution

- **Executor Notes**: Optional field for special instructions to executors

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Database Models**:
  - `Will` model with fields:
    - `user_id`, `death_scenario`, `spouse_primary_beneficiary`
    - `spouse_bequest_percentage`, `executor_notes`
  - `Bequest` model with fields:
    - `user_id`, `beneficiary_name`, `bequest_type`
    - `percentage_of_estate`, `specific_amount`, `specific_asset_description`
    - `conditions`, `priority_order`

- **Database Migration**: `2025_10_21_162955_create_wills_and_bequests_tables.php`

- **API Endpoints** (EstateController):
  ```
  GET    /api/estate/will              # Get user's will configuration
  POST   /api/estate/will              # Create/update will
  GET    /api/estate/bequests          # List all bequests
  POST   /api/estate/bequests          # Create bequest
  PUT    /api/estate/bequests/{id}     # Update bequest
  DELETE /api/estate/bequests/{id}     # Delete bequest
  ```

- **Frontend Component**: `WillPlanning.vue`
  - Integrated into Estate Dashboard as new tab
  - Real-time estate value integration from IHT calculator
  - Visual feedback for tax implications
  - Marital status awareness (shows spouse options only if married)

#### Business Logic:
- **User Death Only Scenario**:
  - If spouse is primary beneficiary:
    - Configured percentage passes to spouse tax-free (unlimited spouse exemption)
    - Remaining estate distributed per bequests, subject to IHT
  - If spouse is NOT primary beneficiary:
    - Entire estate subject to IHT calculation
    - Warning displayed to user

- **Both Dying Simultaneously**:
  - Spouse exemption does NOT apply
  - Full estate value subject to IHT
  - Distribution per bequests to other beneficiaries

#### Integration:
- Links to IHT calculation for net estate value
- Considers death scenario in IHT planning recommendations
- Provides probate readiness insights

### 8. Bug Fixes & Improvements

#### Will Planning Authentication Fix (October 21, 2025)
**Issue**: 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing Will Planning endpoints
**Root Cause**: Component using `window.axios` without Authorization Bearer token

- Updated `WillPlanning.vue` to use `api` service from `@/services/api.js`
- API service includes interceptor to add `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
- All API calls now properly authenticated

**Files Modified**:
- `resources/js/components/Estate/WillPlanning.vue`

#### Investment Account Form Fix (October 21, 2025)

- Updated `AccountForm.vue` dropdown options from 'sole' to 'individual'
- Added 'trust' option to match database enum
- Added `trust_id` field to form data

**Files Modified**:
- `resources/js/components/Investment/AccountForm.vue`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/EstateController.php`
