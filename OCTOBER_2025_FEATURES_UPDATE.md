  - Slider to set percentage (0-100%) of estate to spouse
  - Real-time calculation of amounts:
    - Amount to spouse (tax-free via spouse exemption)
    - Amount to other beneficiaries (subject to IHT)

- **API Endpoints** (EstateController):
  ```
  GET    /api/estate/will              # Get user's will configuration
  POST   /api/estate/will              # Create/update will
  GET    /api/estate/bequests          # List all bequests
  POST   /api/estate/bequests          # Create bequest
  PUT    /api/estate/bequests/{id}     # Update bequest
  DELETE /api/estate/bequests/{id}     # Delete bequest
  ```

    - Remaining estate distributed per bequests, subject to IHT
  - If spouse is NOT primary beneficiary:
    - Entire estate subject to IHT calculation
    - Warning displayed to user

- **Both Dying Simultaneously**:

### 8. Enhanced Protection Analysis with UK Tax Calculations

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: October 21, 2025

#### Features:
- **UK Tax Calculator Service** (NEW):
  - Centralized service for income tax and National Insurance calculations
  - Uses 2025/26 tax year rates (personal allowance, basic/higher/additional rate bands)
  - Calculates Class 1 NI (employees) and Class 4 NI (self-employed)
  - Supports multiple income types: employment, self-employment, rental, dividend, other
  - Returns detailed breakdown: gross income, tax, NI, net income, effective tax rate

- **Enhanced Coverage Gap Analyzer**:
  - Uses NET income (after tax and NI) for human capital calculation
  - Pulls debt from actual mortgages and liabilities tables (real-time data)
  - Tracks spouse income separately with permission checks
  - Spouse income REDUCES protection need (continues after user's death)
  - Excludes rental/dividend income from protection needs (continues after death)
  - Income categorization:
    - **Earned Income** (STOPS on death): Employment, self-employment
    - **Continuing Income** (CONTINUES after death): Rental, dividend
  - Enhanced income breakdown tracking (gross, net, continuing, spouse)

- **Protection Agent Updates**:
  - Integrate UKTaxCalculator for accurate net income calculations
  - Pass spouse income data to gap analyzer
  - Enhanced analysis response with spouse income details
  - Cache invalidation when income changes (user and spouse)

- **Gap Analysis UI Enhancements**:

  - "Spouse Income Not Included" warning when permission denied
  - Comprehensive Protection Needs Breakdown section
  - Income Source Breakdown table with collapsible spouse details
  - Tax & Deductions Breakdown section
  - Spouse permission status and data sharing info
  - Enhanced tooltips and explanations

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Service**: `app/Services/UKTaxCalculator.php` (NEW)
- **Modified Services**:
  - `app/Services/Protection/CoverageGapAnalyzer.php`
  - `app/Agents/ProtectionAgent.php`
- **Modified Controllers**:
  - `app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserProfileController.php` (cache invalidation)
- **Modified Components**:
  - `resources/js/components/Protection/GapAnalysis.vue` (major UI update)
  - `resources/js/components/Protection/CurrentSituation.vue`
  - `resources/js/components/Protection/CoverageGapChart.vue`
  - `resources/js/store/modules/protection.js`

#### Business Logic:
**Income Type Categorization**:
1. **Earned Income** (STOPS on death):
   - Employment income (PAYE)
   - Self-employment income
   - Other earned income

2. **Continuing Income** (CONTINUES after death):
   - Rental income (property continues to generate)
   - Dividend income (investments continue)

**Spouse Income Impact**:
- If spouse permission GRANTED: Include spouse income (REDUCES protection need)
- If spouse permission DENIED: Show warning, exclude spouse income (INCREASES protection need)
- Spouse income continues after user's death, reducing family's income replacement need

**Protection Need Formula**:
```
Protection Need = (User Net Earned Income × Multiplier)
                  + Debts (mortgages + liabilities)
                  - Spouse Net Income (if permission granted)
                  - Continuing Income (rental + dividend)
```

**Cache Strategy**:
- Clear protection cache when user updates income
- Clear spouse's protection cache when linked user updates income
- Ensures real-time recalculation of protection needs

#### Use Case Example:
1. User (male, age 49) logs in as surviving spouse
2. System calculates life expectancy: ~30 years (dies at age 79 in 2054)
3. Checks deceased spouse's NRB usage: £0 used on gifts
4. Transferable NRB: Full £325k (total available NRB = £650k)
5. Projects current estate of £800k to £1.3M at death (growth over 30 years)
6. Calculates IHT: (£1.3M - £650k NRB - £175k RNRB) × 40% = £190k IHT liability
7. User sees full breakdown and can plan accordingly

#### Key Benefits:
- **Actuarially accurate** using real UK ONS data
- **Automatic NRB tracking** - no manual calculation needed
- **Future value projections** - realistic growth assumptions

#### Validation & Error Handling:
- Required fields validated before allowing "Continue"
- Clear error messages on validation failures
- Network error handling with retry options
- Form state preserved on navigation

#### Data Flow:
```
Register → Onboarding (Focus Area) → Steps 1-9 → Completion → Dashboard
                ↓                        ↓
         Set focus area          Save step data
                                  (auto-save)

### 14. Bug Fixes & UI/UX Improvements (October 22, 2025)

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: October 22, 2025

#### Overview:
Comprehensive bug fixes and user experience improvements across Property, Protection, Estate, and User Profile modules.

#### Property Module Fixes:

**1. Net Rental Yield Display Fix**
- **Issue**: Net rental yield not displaying in property detail view despite being calculated
- **Root Cause**: Backend calculated value but didn't include it in top-level response
- **Fix**: Added `net_rental_yield` to top-level fields in PropertyService response (line 138)
- **File**: `app/Services/Property/PropertyService.php`

**2. Property Form Validation & Ownership Type Fixes**
- **Issues**:
  - HTML5 validation blocking submission on hidden required fields
  - 'sole' vs 'individual' enum mismatch causing 500/422 errors
  - Missing `name` attributes preventing focus on invalid fields
- **Root Causes**:
  - Multi-step form with `v-show` causing HTML5 validation conflicts
  - Frontend using 'sole' but database expects 'individual'
  - Form request validation still checking for 'sole'
- **Fixes**:
  - Added `novalidate` attribute to form (disables HTML5 validation)
  - Changed 'sole' → 'individual' in PropertyForm.vue (3 places: default, watcher, populateForm)
  - Updated UpdatePropertyRequest.php validation rule
  - Added `name` attributes to all required form fields
  - Added error display banner with step navigation
  - Enhanced custom validation to show which step has errors
- **Files Modified**:
  - `resources/js/components/NetWorth/Property/PropertyForm.vue`
  - `app/Http/Requests/UpdatePropertyRequest.php`

#### Protection Module Fixes:

**1. "Add Your First Policy" Button Not Working**
- **Issue**: Button in Gap Analysis tab emitted event but nothing happened
- **Root Cause**: GapAnalysis emitted 'add-policy' but ProtectionDashboard didn't listen
- **Fix**: Connected event flow: GapAnalysis → ProtectionDashboard → PolicyDetails modal
- **Files Modified**:
  - `resources/js/views/Protection/ProtectionDashboard.vue`
  - `resources/js/components/Protection/PolicyDetails.vue`

**2. Affordability Calculation Showing £0**
- **Issue**: Premium affordability percentage showed 0%
- **Root Cause**: Used non-existent `profile.monthly_gross_income` field
- **Fix**: Calculate from `grossAnnualIncome` (from analysis) divided by 12
- **File**: `resources/js/components/Protection/GapAnalysis.vue`

**3. Protection Gap Analysis - Life Insurance Allocation & UI Clarity**
- **Issues**:
  - Life insurance incorrectly allocated (subtracted from both debts AND human capital independently)
  - Confusing labels ("Human Capital" used for both NEED and GAP)
  - No visibility into how existing cover is allocated
- **Root Causes**:
  - Backend calculation didn't prioritize debt coverage first
  - Frontend showed same label for different concepts
  - Missing section showing existing coverage allocation
- **Backend Fixes** (`app/Services/Protection/CoverageGapAnalyzer.php`):
  - **STEP 1**: Life insurance covers debts FIRST (priority allocation)
  - **STEP 2**: Any excess after debts reduces human capital (income replacement) need
  - **STEP 3**: Income replacement policies (Family Income Benefit, etc.) tracked separately
  - Returns new data: `coverage_allocated`, `income_replacement_coverage`
- **Frontend Fixes** (`resources/js/components/Protection/GapAnalysis.vue`):
  - Added **"Your Existing Life Insurance Coverage"** section showing:
    - Total life insurance amount
    - Allocation breakdown (debt covered, applied to income replacement, excess unused)
    - Income replacement policies separately (FIB, IP, etc.)
  - Renamed **"Coverage Gaps"** → **"Protection Shortfall"** with clear explanation
  - Better labels: "Income Replacement Gap" and "Debt Protection Gap"
  - Added tooltips explaining allocation logic

#### Estate Module Fixes:

**1. RNRB Label Conditional Display**
- **Issue**: "Total Allowances" card showed "NRB + RNRB" even when RNRB not available
- **Fix**: Show "NRB + RNRB" only when `rnrb_eligible && rnrb > 0`, otherwise show "NRB only"
- **File**: `resources/js/components/Estate/IHTPlanning.vue`

**2. Estate Overview Card Label Simplification**
- **Issue**: Dashboard card showed "After NRB/RNRB allowances" subtitle (confusing)
- **Fix**: Removed subtitle, showing just "Taxable Estate"
- **File**: `resources/js/components/Estate/EstateOverviewCard.vue`

#### User Profile Module Fixes:

**Navigation Fixes in Assets Tab**
- **Issue**: All asset cards navigated to Estate module (incorrect routing)
- **Fix**: Each card now navigates to correct module:
  - **Properties** → Net Worth (Property view) - `NetWorthProperty` route
