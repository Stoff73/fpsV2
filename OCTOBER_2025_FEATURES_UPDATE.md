  - Slider to set percentage (0-100%) of estate to spouse
  - Real-time calculation of amounts:
    - Amount to spouse (tax-free via spouse exemption)
    - Amount to other beneficiaries (subject to IHT)

- **API Endpoints** (EstateController):
  ```
  GET    /api/estate/will              # Get user's will configuration
  POST   /api/estate/will              # Create/update will
  GET    /api/estate/bequests          # List all bequests
  POST   /api/estate/bequests          # Create bequest
  PUT    /api/estate/bequests/{id}     # Update bequest
  DELETE /api/estate/bequests/{id}     # Delete bequest
  ```

    - Remaining estate distributed per bequests, subject to IHT
  - If spouse is NOT primary beneficiary:
    - Entire estate subject to IHT calculation
    - Warning displayed to user

- **Both Dying Simultaneously**:

### 8. Enhanced Protection Analysis with UK Tax Calculations

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: October 21, 2025

#### Features:
- **UK Tax Calculator Service** (NEW):
  - Centralized service for income tax and National Insurance calculations
  - Uses 2025/26 tax year rates (personal allowance, basic/higher/additional rate bands)
  - Calculates Class 1 NI (employees) and Class 4 NI (self-employed)
  - Supports multiple income types: employment, self-employment, rental, dividend, other
  - Returns detailed breakdown: gross income, tax, NI, net income, effective tax rate

- **Enhanced Coverage Gap Analyzer**:
  - Uses NET income (after tax and NI) for human capital calculation
  - Pulls debt from actual mortgages and liabilities tables (real-time data)
  - Tracks spouse income separately with permission checks
  - Spouse income REDUCES protection need (continues after user's death)
  - Excludes rental/dividend income from protection needs (continues after death)
  - Income categorization:
    - **Earned Income** (STOPS on death): Employment, self-employment
    - **Continuing Income** (CONTINUES after death): Rental, dividend
  - Enhanced income breakdown tracking (gross, net, continuing, spouse)

- **Protection Agent Updates**:
  - Integrate UKTaxCalculator for accurate net income calculations
  - Pass spouse income data to gap analyzer
  - Enhanced analysis response with spouse income details
  - Cache invalidation when income changes (user and spouse)

- **Gap Analysis UI Enhancements**:

  - "Spouse Income Not Included" warning when permission denied
  - Comprehensive Protection Needs Breakdown section
  - Income Source Breakdown table with collapsible spouse details
  - Tax & Deductions Breakdown section
  - Spouse permission status and data sharing info
  - Enhanced tooltips and explanations

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Service**: `app/Services/UKTaxCalculator.php` (NEW)
- **Modified Services**:
  - `app/Services/Protection/CoverageGapAnalyzer.php`
  - `app/Agents/ProtectionAgent.php`
- **Modified Controllers**:
  - `app/Http/Controllers/Api/UserProfileController.php` (cache invalidation)
- **Modified Components**:
  - `resources/js/components/Protection/GapAnalysis.vue` (major UI update)
  - `resources/js/components/Protection/CurrentSituation.vue`
  - `resources/js/components/Protection/CoverageGapChart.vue`
  - `resources/js/store/modules/protection.js`

#### Business Logic:
**Income Type Categorization**:
1. **Earned Income** (STOPS on death):
   - Employment income (PAYE)
   - Self-employment income
   - Other earned income

2. **Continuing Income** (CONTINUES after death):
   - Rental income (property continues to generate)
   - Dividend income (investments continue)

**Spouse Income Impact**:
- If spouse permission GRANTED: Include spouse income (REDUCES protection need)
- If spouse permission DENIED: Show warning, exclude spouse income (INCREASES protection need)
- Spouse income continues after user's death, reducing family's income replacement need

**Protection Need Formula**:
```
Protection Need = (User Net Earned Income × Multiplier)
                  + Debts (mortgages + liabilities)
                  - Spouse Net Income (if permission granted)
                  - Continuing Income (rental + dividend)
```

**Cache Strategy**:
- Clear protection cache when user updates income
- Clear spouse's protection cache when linked user updates income
- Ensures real-time recalculation of protection needs

#### Use Case Example:
1. User (male, age 49) logs in as surviving spouse
2. System calculates life expectancy: ~30 years (dies at age 79 in 2054)
3. Checks deceased spouse's NRB usage: £0 used on gifts
4. Transferable NRB: Full £325k (total available NRB = £650k)
5. Projects current estate of £800k to £1.3M at death (growth over 30 years)
6. Calculates IHT: (£1.3M - £650k NRB - £175k RNRB) × 40% = £190k IHT liability
7. User sees full breakdown and can plan accordingly

#### Key Benefits:
- **Actuarially accurate** using real UK ONS data
- **Automatic NRB tracking** - no manual calculation needed
- **Future value projections** - realistic growth assumptions

### 15. Second Death IHT Planning with Complete Cross-Module Data Integration

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: October 23, 2025

#### Overview:
Comprehensive second death IHT planning system that pulls data from ALL modules (Net Worth, Protection, Retirement, User Profile) to provide accurate estate projections, gifting strategies, and life cover recommendations for married couples planning for the surviving spouse's eventual death.

#### Features:

**Actuarial Life Expectancy Calculations**:
- Uses UK ONS National Life Tables (2020-2022) for realistic projections
- Gender-specific life expectancy data for ages 0-100
- Calculates current age, estimated age at death, years until death
- Determines who dies first based on actuarial data
- Projects years between first and second death

**Estate Future Value Projections**:
- Projects both spouses' estates to first death date
- Combines estates at first death (survivor inherits all via spouse exemption)
- Projects combined estate from first death to second death
- Asset-specific growth rates:
  - Property: 3% per annum
  - Investments: 5% per annum
  - Cash/Savings: 4% per annum
  - Pensions: 5% per annum
- Uses 2.5% inflation rate for realistic projections

**NRB Transfer Tracking**:
- Automatically calculates transferred NRB from deceased spouse
- £325,000 base NRB per person
- Full transfer if deceased used £0 on gifts within 7 years
- Total available NRB for survivor: £650,000 (double NRB)
- RNRB also transferable (£175,000 each = £350,000 total if applicable)
- Clear display of "Less: Total NRB (inc. transferred £325,000)"

**Automatic Gifting Strategy Optimization**:
- Prioritizes Potentially Exempt Transfers (PETs) every 7 years
- Annual exemptions (£3,000/year) with carry forward
- Gifting from income if affordable (based on actual expenditure data)
- Chargeable Lifetime Transfers (CLTs) into trusts as last resort
- Detailed implementation steps for each gift type
- Timeline visualization showing gift schedule
- Total IHT saved by following strategy

**Life Cover Recommendations (3 Scenarios)**:
- **Scenario 1: Full Cover**
  - Joint life second death policy
  - Premium estimates based on ages and coverage amount
  - Covers entire IHT liability at second death

- **Scenario 2: Cover Less Gifting**
  - Reduced premiums
  - Accounts for IHT reduction from gifting strategy
  - Lower coverage amount needed

- **Scenario 3: Self-Insurance**
  - Invest premiums instead of buying insurance
  - 4.7% investment return assumption
  - Future value calculation showing investment growth
  - Pros/cons analysis
  - Comparison with traditional life insurance

**Dual Gifting Timelines**:
- Side-by-side ApexCharts rangeBar visualization

- Priority badges (High/Medium/Low) with color coding
- Effectiveness indicators showing IHT savings potential
- Implementation steps for each strategy
- Only shows applicable strategies (smart filtering)
- Strategies include:

  - Life insurance (joint life second death policies)
  - RNRB maximization (downsizing provisions)
  - Charitable giving (reduces estate, lower IHT rate)
  - Trust planning (protecting assets)
  - Pension planning (outside estate if beneficiary nominated)
- Total potential savings summary

**Spouse Exemption Handling**:

- Contextual help explaining why data is needed
- Smart navigation to correct modules:
  - Missing spouse account → User Profile
  - Missing assets → Net Worth/Investment/Savings
  - Missing expenditure → User Profile

#### Use Case Example:

**Scenario: Married Couple Planning for Second Death**

1. **Users**: John (age 49, male) and Jane (age 45, female), married
2. **Assets**:
   - Joint property: £800,000
   - John's investments: £200,000
   - Jane's investments: £150,000
   - Joint savings: £50,000
   - John's DC pension: £100,000 (IHT exempt with beneficiary)
3. **Liabilities**: Mortgage £150,000
4. **Existing Life Insurance**: £100,000 joint life second death policy

**Calculation Process**:

1. **Life Expectancy**:
   - John: 32.3 years remaining → dies at age 81 (2056)
   - Jane: 39.9 years remaining → dies at age 85 (2064)
   - Jane survives John by 4 years

2. **First Death (John in 2056)**:
   - John's projected estate at death: £650,000 (after growth)
   - Passes to Jane tax-free (spouse exemption)
   - IHT at first death: £0
   - Jane inherits everything

3. **Second Death (Jane in 2064)**:
   - Jane's own projected estate: £450,000
   - Inherited from John: £650,000
   - Combined estate at Jane's death: £1,100,000
   - Less: Mortgage paid off by then: £0
   - Net estate: £1,100,000

4. **IHT Calculation at Second Death**:
   - Net estate: £1,100,000
   - Less: Total NRB (inc. transferred £325,000): -£650,000
   - Less: RNRB (residence nil rate band): -£175,000
   - Taxable estate: £275,000
   - IHT at 40%: £110,000

5. **Gifting Strategy**:
   - Annual exemptions: £3,000/year × 8 years = £24,000
   - PETs every 7 years: £100,000 (2032), £100,000 (2039)
   - Total gifted: £224,000
   - IHT saved: £89,600 (£224,000 × 40%)

6. **Life Cover Recommendation**:
   - IHT liability: £110,000
   - Less: Existing cover: -£100,000
   - Less: Gifting savings: -£89,600
   - Net gap: £0 (over-covered)
   - Recommendation: Existing cover is sufficient

**Result**: System shows Jane needs NO additional life insurance if gifting strategy is followed, saving thousands in premiums.

#### Benefits:

- **Accuracy**: Uses real UK actuarial data, not guesstimates
- **Comprehensive**: Pulls ALL data from ALL modules automatically
- **Actionable**: Provides specific implementation steps
- **Visual**: Timeline charts show gifting schedule clearly
- **Flexible**: Handles missing data gracefully
- **Educational**: Explains why data is needed
- **Cost-Effective**: Self-insurance option analyzed
- **Smart**: Only recommends cover actually needed (accounts for existing)
- **UK-Specific**: Follows all UK IHT rules (spouse exemption, NRB transfer, RNRB, PETs, CLTs)

#### Future Enhancements:

1. **Downloadable Reports**: PDF export of full analysis
2. **What-If Scenarios**: Test different gifting amounts/timings
3. **Trust Comparison**: Show IHT with vs. without trust planning
4. **Annual Review**: Track actual vs. projected over time
5. **Gift Tracker**: Record actual gifts made, update projections
6. **Multiple Scenarios**: Compare different death sequences

### 14. Bug Fixes & UI/UX Improvements (October 22, 2025)

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: October 22, 2025

#### Overview:
Comprehensive bug fixes and user experience improvements across Property, Protection, Estate, and User Profile modules.

#### Property Module Fixes:

**1. Net Rental Yield Display Fix**
- **Issue**: Net rental yield not displaying in property detail view despite being calculated
- **Root Cause**: Backend calculated value but didn't include it in top-level response
- **Fix**: Added `net_rental_yield` to top-level fields in PropertyService response (line 138)
- **File**: `app/Services/Property/PropertyService.php`

**2. Property Form Validation & Ownership Type Fixes**
- **Issues**:
  - HTML5 validation blocking submission on hidden required fields
  - 'sole' vs 'individual' enum mismatch causing 500/422 errors
  - Missing `name` attributes preventing focus on invalid fields
- **Root Causes**:
  - Multi-step form with `v-show` causing HTML5 validation conflicts
  - Frontend using 'sole' but database expects 'individual'
  - Form request validation still checking for 'sole'
- **Fixes**:
  - Added `novalidate` attribute to form (disables HTML5 validation)
  - Changed 'sole' → 'individual' in PropertyForm.vue (3 places: default, watcher, populateForm)
  - Updated UpdatePropertyRequest.php validation rule
  - Added `name` attributes to all required form fields
  - Added error display banner with step navigation
  - Enhanced custom validation to show which step has errors
- **Files Modified**:
  - `resources/js/components/NetWorth/Property/PropertyForm.vue`
  - `app/Http/Requests/UpdatePropertyRequest.php`

#### Protection Module Fixes:

**1. "Add Your First Policy" Button Not Working**
- **Issue**: Button in Gap Analysis tab emitted event but nothing happened
- **Root Cause**: GapAnalysis emitted 'add-policy' but ProtectionDashboard didn't listen
- **Fix**: Connected event flow: GapAnalysis → ProtectionDashboard → PolicyDetails modal
- **Files Modified**:
  - `resources/js/views/Protection/ProtectionDashboard.vue`
  - `resources/js/components/Protection/PolicyDetails.vue`

**2. Affordability Calculation Showing £0**
- **Issue**: Premium affordability percentage showed 0%
- **Root Cause**: Used non-existent `profile.monthly_gross_income` field
- **Fix**: Calculate from `grossAnnualIncome` (from analysis) divided by 12
- **File**: `resources/js/components/Protection/GapAnalysis.vue`

**3. Protection Gap Analysis - Life Insurance Allocation & UI Clarity**
- **Issues**:
  - Life insurance incorrectly allocated (subtracted from both debts AND human capital independently)
  - Confusing labels ("Human Capital" used for both NEED and GAP)
  - No visibility into how existing cover is allocated
- **Root Causes**:
  - Backend calculation didn't prioritize debt coverage first
  - Frontend showed same label for different concepts
  - Missing section showing existing coverage allocation
- **Backend Fixes** (`app/Services/Protection/CoverageGapAnalyzer.php`):
  - **STEP 1**: Life insurance covers debts FIRST (priority allocation)
  - **STEP 2**: Any excess after debts reduces human capital (income replacement) need
  - **STEP 3**: Income replacement policies (Family Income Benefit, etc.) tracked separately
  - Returns new data: `coverage_allocated`, `income_replacement_coverage`
- **Frontend Fixes** (`resources/js/components/Protection/GapAnalysis.vue`):
  - Added **"Your Existing Life Insurance Coverage"** section showing:
    - Total life insurance amount
    - Allocation breakdown (debt covered, applied to income replacement, excess unused)
    - Income replacement policies separately (FIB, IP, etc.)
  - Renamed **"Coverage Gaps"** → **"Protection Shortfall"** with clear explanation
  - Better labels: "Income Replacement Gap" and "Debt Protection Gap"
  - Added tooltips explaining allocation logic

#### Estate Module Fixes:

**1. RNRB Label Conditional Display**
- **Issue**: "Total Allowances" card showed "NRB + RNRB" even when RNRB not available
- **Fix**: Show "NRB + RNRB" only when `rnrb_eligible && rnrb > 0`, otherwise show "NRB only"
- **File**: `resources/js/components/Estate/IHTPlanning.vue`

**2. Estate Overview Card Label Simplification**
- **Issue**: Dashboard card showed "After NRB/RNRB allowances" subtitle (confusing)
- **Fix**: Removed subtitle, showing just "Taxable Estate"
- **File**: `resources/js/components/Estate/EstateOverviewCard.vue`

#### User Profile Module Fixes:

**Navigation Fixes in Assets Tab**
- **Issue**: All asset cards navigated to Estate module (incorrect routing)
- **Fix**: Each card now navigates to correct module:
  - **Properties** → Net Worth (Property view) - `NetWorthProperty` route
  - **Investments** → Investment module - `Investment` route
  - **Cash** → Savings module - `Savings` route
  - **Business Interests** → Estate module (Business tab) - `Estate` route with query param
  - **Chattels** → Estate module (Chattels tab) - `Estate` route with query param
  - **Pensions** → Retirement module - `Retirement` route (already correct)
- **File**: `resources/js/components/UserProfile/AssetsOverview.vue`

#### Files Modified Summary:

**Backend (7 files)**:
```
app/Services/Property/PropertyService.php
app/Services/Protection/CoverageGapAnalyzer.php
app/Http/Requests/UpdatePropertyRequest.php
app/Http/Controllers/Api/PropertyController.php (cache invalidation)
app/Http/Controllers/Api/SavingsController.php (cache invalidation)
```

**Frontend (9 files)**:
```
resources/js/components/NetWorth/Property/PropertyForm.vue
resources/js/components/NetWorth/Property/PropertyDetail.vue
resources/js/components/Protection/GapAnalysis.vue
resources/js/components/Protection/PolicyDetails.vue
resources/js/views/Protection/ProtectionDashboard.vue
resources/js/components/Estate/IHTPlanning.vue
resources/js/components/Estate/EstateOverviewCard.vue
resources/js/components/UserProfile/AssetsOverview.vue
resources/js/views/Dashboard.vue (refresh button cache fix)
```

#### Testing:
- ✅ Property form editing with NULL purchase_date values
- ✅ Property form validation error display and navigation
- ✅ Ownership type 'individual' saving correctly
- ✅ Net rental yield displaying in property details
- ✅ "Add Your First Policy" button opens modal
- ✅ Affordability calculation shows correct percentage
- ✅ Life insurance allocation logic correct (debts first, then income)
- ✅ Protection gap labels clear and unambiguous
- ✅ RNRB label conditionally displayed
- ✅ Estate card simplified
- ✅ User profile asset cards navigate to correct modules

#### Cache Invalidation Improvements:

### 16. Life Policy Strategy: Whole of Life Insurance vs. Self-Insurance

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date**: October 23, 2025

#### Overview:
Comprehensive life insurance strategy analysis that compares purchasing a Whole of Life insurance policy with the alternative of investing the equivalent premium amount over the user's expected lifetime. Uses real UK insurance market premium rates and provides detailed cost-benefit analysis with investment projections.

#### Features:

**UK Market-Based Premium Table**:
- Comprehensive premium rates for ages 18-90
- Gender-specific rates (females ~20% cheaper on average)
- Based on 2025 UK market averages from major insurers:
  - Aviva
  - Legal & General
  - Royal London
- Monthly premiums per £1,000 of cover
- Linear interpolation for ages between table entries
- Age loading factors (0.8x for under 40, up to 4.0x for 70+)

**Joint Life Second Death Policies**:
- Automatically calculated for married users
- Approximately 25% cheaper than two single policies
- Average age of both spouses used for rate calculation
- Specific for IHT planning (pays out on second death only)

**Whole of Life Insurance Analysis**:
- Monthly and annual premium calculations
- Total premiums paid over expected lifetime
- Cost-benefit ratio (£ coverage per £1 of premiums)
- Guaranteed payout amount
- Key features and benefits
- 6-step implementation guide
- Policy type description (single vs. joint life)

**Self-Insurance Investment Strategy**:
- Monthly investment amount (same as premium)
- 4.7% assumed annual investment return (conservative long-term average)
- Future value calculation using annuity formula: `FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r`
- Total invested vs. investment growth breakdown
- Projected fund value at expected death
- Coverage percentage vs. IHT target
- Shortfall or surplus calculation
- Confidence levels:
  - Very High: 120%+ coverage
  - High: 110-120% coverage
  - Medium-High: 100-110% coverage
  - Medium: 90-100% coverage
  - Medium-Low: 75-90% coverage
  - Low: <75% coverage

**Comprehensive Comparison**:
- Side-by-side comparison across 6 key aspects:
  1. Certainty (guaranteed payout vs. investment risk)
  2. Flexibility (fixed premiums vs. adjustable contributions)
  3. Cost Effectiveness (cost-benefit ratios)
  4. Early Death Risk (immediate cover vs. insufficient accumulation)
  5. Longevity Risk (ongoing premiums vs. surplus growth)
  6. Tax Efficiency (trust proceeds vs. ISA/Bond wrappers)

**Pros and Cons Analysis**:
- **Self-Insurance Pros** (6 items):
  - Funds remain accessible before death
  - Potential for higher returns than insurance cost
  - Flexibility to adjust contributions
  - No medical underwriting required
  - Tax-efficient wrappers available (ISA, Bond, Pension)
  - Surplus can be passed to beneficiaries
- **Self-Insurance Cons** (6 items):
  - Investment risk (markets may underperform 4.7%)
  - No guaranteed payout
  - Requires financial discipline
  - Early death means insufficient accumulation
  - Inflation risk
  - Temptation to access funds for other purposes

**Decision Framework**:
Three clear criteria sets to help users choose:
- **Choose Insurance if**:
  - Want guaranteed coverage from day one
  - Prefer certainty over potential returns
  - Have health conditions (lock in rates now)
  - Lack discipline to maintain investments
  - Cost-benefit ratio is very favorable (>2.0)
- **Choose Self-Insurance if**:
  - Projected returns cover 110%+ of target
  - Have strong financial discipline
  - Want to retain control of capital
  - Have long time horizon (20+ years)
  - Comfortable with investment risk
- **Choose Hybrid if**:
  - Want some guaranteed base cover
  - Projected returns are 90-110% of target
  - Want balance between certainty and flexibility
  - Can afford split approach

**Recommended Investment Approach** (for self-insurance):
- Asset Allocation: Balanced portfolio (60% equities, 40% bonds)
- Tax Wrapper: Investment Bond or ISA
- Review Frequency: Quarterly portfolio review, annual contribution increase
- Risk Management: De-risk portfolio as you age (shift to bonds in final 10 years)

**Prioritized Recommendations**:
Automatic ranking of three options:
1. Self-Insurance (if coverage ≥100%)
2. Whole of Life Insurance (based on cost-benefit ratio)
3. Hybrid Approach (combining both strategies)

Each recommendation includes:
- Priority level (1-3)
- Rationale based on calculations
- Suitability statement (who it's best for)

#### Technical Implementation:

**Backend Service**:
`LifePolicyStrategyService.php` (845 lines):

**Premium Table Constants**:
```php
private const PREMIUM_TABLE = [
    18 => [0.80, 0.65],  // [male, female] rates
    20 => [0.80, 0.65],
    25 => [0.85, 0.70],

- Years Until Death: 29
- Marital Status: Single

**Whole of Life Policy Output**:
- Monthly Premium: £17,664.79
- Annual Premium: £211,977.50
- Total Premiums Paid (29 years): £6,147,347.36
- Cover Amount: £6,400,286.69
- Cost-Benefit Ratio: **1.04:1**
- Policy Type: Whole of Life (Single Life)

**Self-Insurance Output**:
- Monthly Investment: £17,664.79
- Annual Investment: £211,977.50
- Investment Term: 29 years
- Total Invested: £6,147,347.50
- Investment Growth (at 4.7%): £6,428,700.44
- Projected Fund Value: **£12,576,047.94**
- Coverage Percentage: **196.5%**
- Surplus: £6,175,761.25
- Confidence Level: **Very High**

**Recommendation**: **Self-Insurance**
- Rationale: Projected investment returns cover 197% of IHT liability. You keep control of funds and potential surplus.
- Suitability: Best if you have financial discipline and comfortable with investment risk.

**Key Insight**: Self-insurance approach nearly doubles the IHT coverage compared to insurance cost!

#### Premium Rate Examples (UK Market 2025):

| Age | Male (£/month per £1k) | Female (£/month per £1k) |
|-----|----------------------|------------------------|
| 30  | 0.95                | 0.80                   |
| 40  | 1.40                | 1.20                   |
| 50  | 2.55                | 2.10                   |
| 60  | 5.20                | 4.15                   |
| 70  | 12.50               | 9.80                   |
| 80  | 31.00               | 24.00                  |

**Joint Life Second Death**: 75% of average single rate
- Example (both age 50): (2.55 + 2.10) / 2 = 2.325 × 0.75 = **£1.74** per £1k
