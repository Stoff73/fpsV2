## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Monte Carlo simulations are slow
**Mitigation**:
- Use Laravel Queue for background processing
- Show progress indicator
- Cache results for 24 hours
- Optimize simulation algorithm

**Risk**: Plan generation is complex and brittle
**Mitigation**:
- Modular service design
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Graceful degradation (show partial plan if some data missing)
- Clear error messages

**Risk**: Cross-module integration breaks existing functionality
**Mitigation**:
- Extensive integration testing
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Clear API contracts

### User Experience Risks

**Risk**: Users overwhelmed by complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Progressive disclosure (show summary first, details on demand)
- Contextual help and tooltips
- Guided workflows
- Simplified language (avoid jargon)

**Risk**: Recommendations not actionable
**Mitigation**:
- Specific action steps (not vague advice)
- Priority ranking
- "Quick wins" highlighted
- Integration with real actions (e.g., rebalancing calculator)

---

## Future Enhancements (v0.3+)

### Advanced Features
- Portfolio backtesting
- ESG/Sustainable investing tracking
- Factor exposure analysis
- Currency hedging analysis
- Leverage/borrowing optimization
- Tax-aware asset location optimizer
- Robo-advisor automation (auto-rebalancing)

### Integrations
- Open Banking integration (live portfolio import)
- Broker API integrations (execute trades)
- HMRC integration (auto-populate tax data)
- External portfolio tracking services

### AI/ML Features
- Predictive analytics (market forecasting)
- Behavioral coaching (prevent panic selling)
- Natural language plan generation
- Chatbot for investment questions

## Appendix

### Key Formulas & Calculations

**Portfolio Health Score (0-100):**
```
Score = (
    DiversificationScore * 0.25 +
    RiskAlignmentScore * 0.20 +
    TaxEfficiencyScore * 0.20 +
    FeeScore * 0.15 +
    GoalProgressScore * 0.20
)
```

**Recommendation Priority Score:**
```
Priority = (
    PotentialImpact * 0.40 +
    Urgency * 0.30 +
    EaseOfImplementation * 0.20 +
    TaxSaving * 0.10
)
```

**Rebalancing Threshold:**
```
Trigger rebalancing if:
  ABS(CurrentAllocation - TargetAllocation) > Threshold
  Default threshold: 5%
```

**Tax Loss Harvesting Opportunity:**
```
If:
  UnrealizedLoss > £500
  AND RealizedGains > 0
  AND NoWashSaleViolation
Then: Recommend harvesting
```

## Conclusion

This expansion transforms the Investment module from a basic portfolio tracker into a comprehensive financial planning tool that rivals professional adviser software. The phased approach ensures:

1. **Quick wins**: Core features (plan, recommendations, scenarios) in first 3 weeks
2. **Solid foundation**: Advanced tools build on core infrastructure
3. **Integration**: Holistic planning across all modules
4. **User value**: Actionable advice, not just data

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Set up project tracking (GitHub issues/projects)
3. Begin Phase 1, Week 1 implementation
4. Weekly progress reviews and adjustments
