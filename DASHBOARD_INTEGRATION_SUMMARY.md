```

### Caching Strategy
```
Layer 1: Component Level
- Vuex store caches data in memory
- Prevents unnecessary re-fetching during session

Layer 2: API Level (Laravel Cache)
- Dashboard data: 5 minutes TTL
- Financial health score: 1 hour TTL
- Alerts: 15 minutes TTL
- Cache key format: {type}_{user_id}

Cache Invalidation:
- Manual: POST /api/dashboard/invalidate-cache
- Automatic: After any module data update (future enhancement)
```
