## Step 1: Backup Current Production (5 minutes)

**Via SSH**:
```bash
ssh [username]@csjones.co -p18765

# Navigate to application root
cd ~/tengo-app

# Create backup directory with timestamp
mkdir -p ~/backups
backup_name="tengo-v0.2.9-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p ~/backups/$backup_name

# Backup critical files
cp -r app/ ~/backups/$backup_name/

# Note: Database backup NOT needed (no schema changes)

echo "Backup created at: ~/backups/$backup_name"
```

**Purpose**: Provides rollback capability if issues occur

---

## Step 2: Upload Changed Backend Files (5 minutes)

Action: Overwrite existing files
```

**Via SiteGround File Manager**:
1. Go to Site Tools > File Manager
2. Navigate to `~/tengo-app/app/`
3. Upload each file, replacing existing versions

---

### Upload Method

**Via FTP/SFTP**:
```
Local Path: /Users/Chris/Desktop/fpsApp/tengo/resources/
Remote Path: ~/tengo-app/resources/
Action: Overwrite existing files + upload new files
```

---

## Step 4: Delete Deprecated Assets (1 minute)

### Delete Deprecated Assets

**Via SSH**:
```bash
cd ~/tengo-app
rm -f white.png
```

**Or via File Manager**: Delete `white.png` from root directory

---

## Step 5: Rebuild Frontend Production Assets (3 minutes)

**Critical**: Frontend components have changed, so we MUST rebuild the production assets.

**Via SSH**:
```bash
cd ~/tengo-app

# Clean old build artifacts
rm -rf public/build/*

# Run production build
NODE_ENV=production npm run build

# Verify manifest.json location (CRITICAL)
ls -la public/build/manifest.json
# Must show: public/build/manifest.json (NOT in .vite/ subdirectory)

# Verify assets compiled
ls public/build/assets/ | wc -l
# Should show: 100+ files
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✓ built in 18-20s
public/build/manifest.json created
public/build/assets/ contains 100+ files
```

**Important**: If build fails, check:
1. Node.js version: `node -v` (should be v14+)
2. NPM dependencies: `npm ci` (reinstall if needed)
3. Disk space: `df -h` (ensure sufficient space)

---

## Step 6: Clear Laravel Caches (2 minutes)

**Via SSH**:
```bash
cd ~/tengo-app

# Clear all caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear

# Rebuild production caches
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache

# Run optimization
php artisan optimize

# Verify permissions
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Application cache cleared successfully.
Compiled views cleared successfully.
Configuration cache cleared successfully.
Route cache cleared successfully.
Configuration cached successfully.
Routes cached successfully.
Blade templates cached successfully.
Files cached successfully.
```

---

## Step 7: Post-Deployment Verification (5 minutes)

### Smoke Tests

**1. Homepage Load Test**:
```
URL: https://csjones.co/tengo
Expected: Homepage loads without errors
```

**2. User Login Test**:
```
URL: https://csjones.co/tengo/login
Credentials: demo@fps.com / password
Expected: Successful login and redirect to dashboard
```

**3. Dashboard Cards Test**:
```
Action: Login and view dashboard
Expected:
- Net Worth card shows clickable navigation
- Estate Planning card displays correctly
- Protection card shows coverage indicators
- Trusts card shows "Coming Soon" placeholder
```

**4. User Profile Test**:
```
Action: Navigate to User Profile > Household Expenditure
Expected:
- Three tabs visible: My Expenditure, Spouse's Expenditure, Household Total
- Financial commitments auto-populated from assets/liabilities
- No duplicate expenditure forms
- Totals calculate correctly including commitments
```

**5. Onboarding Flow Test**:
```
Action: Create new test account and start onboarding
Expected:
- Steps reordered correctly (Income at step 7, Expenditure at step 8)
- Rental income displays after adding property
- All forms load without errors
```

**6. Footer Version Test**:
```
Action: Scroll to footer on any page
Expected: Footer shows "v0.2.10" and "Boma Build" link
```

### Error Log Check

**Via SSH**:
```bash
cd ~/tengo-app

# Check Laravel logs for errors (last 50 lines)
tail -50 storage/logs/laravel.log

# Check for PHP errors
tail -50 storage/logs/laravel-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log
```

**Expected**: No new errors, warnings acceptable

**Via SiteGround**:
```
Site Tools > Statistics > Error Log
Expected: No 500 errors, no fatal PHP errors
```

---

## Step 8: Monitoring (15-30 minutes after deployment)

**Monitor for**:
1. Error rate spikes in Laravel logs
2. User-reported issues with expenditure forms
3. Dashboard card rendering issues
4. Financial commitments calculation errors

**Commands**:
```bash
# Follow Laravel log in real-time
tail -f ~/tengo-app/storage/logs/laravel.log

# Check last 100 log entries
tail -100 ~/tengo-app/storage/logs/laravel.log | grep ERROR
```

---

## Rollback Procedure (if needed)

If critical issues occur, rollback to v0.2.9:

**Via SSH**:
```bash
cd ~/tengo-app

# Stop any running processes
pkill -f "artisan"

# Restore backend files
backup_name="[your backup directory name from Step 1]"
cp -r ~/backups/$backup_name/app/ ./
cp ~/backups/$backup_name/api.php routes/

# Restore frontend files
cp -r ~/backups/$backup_name/resources/js/ resources/

# Rebuild frontend
NODE_ENV=production npm run build

# Clear caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan route:clear

# Rebuild caches
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache

# Verify
curl -I https://csjones.co/tengo
```

**No database rollback needed** (no migrations in v0.2.10)
