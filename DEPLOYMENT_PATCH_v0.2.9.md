**Implementation**:

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Estate Plan Spouse Data Integration (Plans Module)

**Issue**: Comprehensive Estate Plan only showing user data, not spouse data.

**Root Cause**: `ComprehensiveEstatePlanService` gathered spouse data but never passed it to build methods.

**Fix**:
- Added spouse asset gathering when data sharing enabled
- Enhanced `buildBalanceSheet()`, `buildEstateOverview()`, `buildEstateBreakdown()` to accept spouse parameters
- Returns structured data: user/spouse/combined sections

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Services/Estate/ComprehensiveEstatePlanService.php`

**Lines Changed**: 65-71, 143-145, 259-723 (major refactor of build methods)

**Result**: Estate Plan now shows complete user/spouse/combined financial picture.

### 2. IHT Planning Liability Display Fix

**Issue**: Non-mortgage liabilities not displaying in IHT Planning breakdown.

**Root Cause**: Wrong field names (`amount`, `description` instead of `current_balance`, `liability_name`).

**Fix**: Corrected field names in `formatLiabilitiesBreakdown()` method.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/Estate/IHTController.php`

**Lines Changed**: 302-313 (user), 368-379 (spouse)

**Result**: All liability types now visible (credit cards, loans, hire purchase, etc.).

### 3. Expenditure Data Display Fix

**Issue**: Expenditure tab showing zeros despite data in database.

**Root Cause**: Service expected flat data but received nested structure (separate mode).

**Fix**: Enhanced `OnboardingService.processExpenditureInfo()` to detect and handle both structures.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Services/Onboarding/OnboardingService.php`

**Lines Changed**: 462-540

**Result**: Expenditure displays correctly for all modes (single/joint/separate).

### 4. Net Worth Card Liability Display

**Issue**: Only mortgages showing, missing other liability types.

**Root Cause**: Using deprecated `PersonalAccount` model instead of `Liability` model.

**Fix**:
- Replaced with `Liability` model queries
- Added comprehensive type categorization
- Returns structured breakdown by type

**Files Modified**:
- `app/Services/NetWorth/NetWorthService.php`

**Result**: Complete liability breakdown with all types visible.

### 5. Property Form Mortgage Ownership Sync

**Issue**: Joint properties creating individual mortgages instead of joint.

**Root Cause**: Mortgage form ownership not syncing with property form ownership.

**Fix**: Added Vue watchers to sync ownership data automatically.

**Files Modified**:
- `resources/js/components/NetWorth/Property/PropertyForm.vue`

**Result**: Joint properties with mortgages now create reciprocal records for both owners.

sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

**Note**: Database restore is preferred over manual rollback as it's faster and safer.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### ✅ All Known Issues Resolved

All issues reported in v0.2.8 have been addressed in this release:
- ✅ Estate plan spouse data integration
- ✅ IHT liability display
- ✅ Expenditure data display
- ✅ Net Worth card liabilities
- ✅ Property ownership sync

### Future Enhancements (Non-Urgent)

From code quality audit:
1. Refactor large service files into focused components
2. Centralize duplicate liability calculation logic
3. Add unit tests for new expenditure mode logic
4. Consider caching strategy for managing agent lookups
5. Remove console.log statements from IHTPlanning.vue

---

## Performance Impact

**Expected Impact**: Minimal (No Performance Degradation)

**Database**:
- 60+ new fields across 8 tables → Negligible storage increase
- Indexed foreign keys maintained → Query performance unchanged
- No new complex joins introduced

**Application**:
- More efficient liability queries (using Liability model)
- Caching strategy maintained throughout
- No N+1 query issues (verified by code audit)

**Frontend**:
- Asset bundle size increase: ~15KB (compressed)
- No additional HTTP requests
- Conditional rendering for new features (no load when not used)

**Positive Changes**:
- Eliminated deprecated PersonalAccount queries
- Reduced redundant API calls in estate planning
- Improved data aggregation efficiency

## Migration Dependency Graph

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Some migrations depend on others. Run ALL migrations in chronological order.

**Key Dependencies**:
1. Migration 19 (remove part_and_part) **REQUIRES** Migration 14 (add mixed) to run first
2. Migration 10 (family names) includes data transformation - cannot be reversed without data loss
3. Migrations 7 & 8 are duplicates (safeguard) - both safe to run

**Recommended Approach**: Run `php artisan migrate --force` which executes in correct order automatically.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Check Application Logs
```bash
# Laravel application logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log

# Nginx error logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# PHP-FPM logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/php8.2-fpm.log
```

### Common Issues After Deployment

**Issue**: "Column not found: managing_agent_name"
- **Cause**: Migrations didn't run
- **Fix**: Run `php artisan migrate --force`

**Issue**: Expenditure still showing zeros
- **Cause**: Browser cache or old data structure
- **Fix**: Clear browser cache, re-submit expenditure via User Profile

**Issue**: Mixed mortgage percentages not saving
- **Cause**: Form validation or database issue
- **Fix**: Check laravel.log for validation errors, verify migration 14 ran

**Issue**: Spouse data not showing in estate plan
- **Cause**: Permissions not accepted or data sharing disabled
- **Fix**: Check `spouse_permissions` table, verify `data_sharing_enabled` flag

**Issue**: Managing agent fields not visible
- **Cause**: Property type not BTL
- **Fix**: Fields only show for property_type = 'buy_to_let'

### Database Verification Commands
```bash
# Verify new fields exist
mysql -u [user] -p [database] -e "SHOW COLUMNS FROM mortgages LIKE '%mixed%';"
mysql -u [user] -p [database] -e "SHOW COLUMNS FROM properties LIKE '%managing_agent%';"
mysql -u [user] -p [database] -e "SHOW COLUMNS FROM users LIKE '%expenditure%';"

# Check migration status
php artisan migrate:status | grep "2025_11_1[2-5]"

# Verify services running
sudo systemctl status php8.2-fpm
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

### Quick Health Check Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== TenGo v0.2.9 Health Check ==="
echo ""
echo "1. Checking PHP-FPM..."
sudo systemctl is-active php8.2-fpm

echo "2. Checking Nginx..."
sudo systemctl is-active nginx

echo "3. Checking Database Connection..."
php artisan tinker --execute="DB::connection()->getPdo(); echo 'Connected';"

echo "4. Checking Migrations..."
php artisan migrate:status | tail -25

echo "5. Checking Cache..."
php artisan cache:clear
echo "Cache cleared"

echo ""
echo "=== Health Check Complete ==="
