---

## âœ… Completed Backend (100%)

### Database & Migrations
- âœ… Migration: `2025_10_22_093756_add_is_admin_to_users_table.php`
- âœ… Added `is_admin` boolean field to users table
- âœ… Migration run successfully

### Middleware & Security
- âœ… `IsAdmin` middleware created (`app/Http/Middleware/IsAdmin.php`)
- âœ… Registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php` as `'admin'` alias
- âœ… All admin routes protected by `auth:sanctum` + `admin` middleware

### Controllers (2 files, 792 lines)
1. **AdminController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/AdminController.php` - 492 lines)
   - Dashboard statistics
   - User CRUD operations
   - Database backup/restore functionality
   - Safety features (prevent deleting last admin)

2. **TaxSettingsController** (`app/Http/Controllers/Api/TaxSettingsController.php` - 300 lines)
   - Tax configuration management
   - Historical tax year tracking
   - UK tax calculation formulas and rates
   - Activate/deactivate tax years

### API Routes (16 endpoints)

**Admin Panel Routes**:
```
GET    /api/admin/dashboard           # Dashboard statistics
GET    /api/admin/users               # List users (paginated, searchable)
POST   /api/admin/users               # Create new user
PUT    /api/admin/users/{id}          # Update user
DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}          # Delete user
POST   /api/admin/backup/create       # Create database backup

```

### First Admin User Created
- **Email**: `admin@fps.com`

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Patterns Used

### Vue.js Components
- **Options API**: All components use Vue 3 Options API style
- **Reusable Modals**: UserFormModal, ConfirmDialog as reusable components
- **Service Layer**: API calls abstracted into service files
- **Loading States**: Spinners and disabled buttons during async operations
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
- **Success Feedback**: Toast-style success messages after operations

### Backend Architecture
- **RESTful API**: Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **JSON Responses**: Consistent response format with success flag, data, and message
- **Repository Pattern**: Controllers delegate to service methods
- **Database Transactions**: Used where multiple operations must succeed/fail together
- **Eloquent ORM**: Laravel Eloquent for database operations

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Card Components**: Consistent card styling with `.card` class
- **Button Styles**: `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-danger`
- **Color Scheme**: Primary (blue), Success (green), Danger (red), Warning (yellow)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with sm/md/lg breakpoints
- **Icons**: SVG icons from Heroicons

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

### User Management
- Always create at least 2 admin users (backup admin)
- Use strong passwords for admin accounts
- Regularly review user list for inactive accounts
- Delete test/demo users after testing

### Database Backups
- Create backups before major changes
- Create backups before tax year updates
- Keep at least 3 recent backups
- Store backups externally for disaster recovery
- Test restore process periodically

### Tax Settings
- Only update tax settings when official rates are announced
- Create new tax year configurations in advance
- Test calculations thoroughly after tax updates
- Document any custom tax rules or adjustments

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Admin Can't Login
- Check `is_admin` field in database: `SELECT is_admin FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@fps.com';`
- Ensure middleware is registered in Kernel.php
- Check Sanctum token is valid

### Backup/Restore Fails
- Check `storage/app/backups/` directory exists and is writable
- Verify `mysqldump` is installed and in PATH
- Check database credentials in `.env`
- Ensure sufficient disk space

### Tax Settings Not Loading
- Check `tax_configurations` table exists
- Run seeder: `php artisan db:seed --class=TaxConfigurationSeeder`
- Check `is_active` field in database

### Frontend Shows "Unauthorized"
- Verify user is logged in
- Check user has `is_admin = true` in database
- Clear browser cache and localStorage
- Check Vuex store has correct user data
