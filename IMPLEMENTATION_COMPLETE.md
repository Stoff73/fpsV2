## üöÄ Next Steps: Testing

### Step 1: Clear Caches
```bash
cd /Users/Chris/Desktop/fpsV2

# Clear Laravel caches
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear

# Rebuild frontend assets
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Start Development Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1: Laravel backend
php artisan serve

# Terminal 2: Vite frontend (HMR)
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Create Test Users

**Married User with Spouse Linked (Full Functionality)**
```sql
-- User 1: John (main)
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, marital_status, date_of_birth, gender, spouse_id)
VALUES ('John Test', 'john@test.com', '$2y$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi', 'married', '1975-05-15', 'male', 2);

-- User 2: Jane (spouse)
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, marital_status, date_of_birth, gender, spouse_id)
VALUES ('Jane Test', 'jane@test.com', '$2y$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi', 'married', '1978-08-22', 'female', 1);

-- Enable data sharing
INSERT INTO spouse_permissions (user_id, spouse_id, permission_type, can_view, can_edit, status)
VALUES (1, 2, 'estate_planning', true, false, 'accepted');

-- Add some assets for both users
-- Add properties, investments, cash accounts
-- Add some gifts within 7 years
-- Create IHT profiles
```

### Step 4: Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Married User with Full Data ‚úì
1. Login as John
2. Navigate to Estate Planning ‚Üí IHT Planning tab
3. **Expected:**
   - Spouse exemption notice displays
   - Three summary cards (First Death, Second Death, Total IHT)
   - Dual gifting timelines appear
   - IHT mitigation strategies accordion
   - Life cover recommendations with 3 tabs
   - All data loads correctly

#### Scenario 2: Married User without Data Sharing ‚úì
1. Disable data sharing in spouse_permissions
2. Reload IHT Planning tab
3. **Expected:**
   - Spouse exemption notice still shows
   - Spouse gifting timeline shows empty state with message
   - Second death calculation uses only user's assets
   - Mitigation strategies still provided

#### Scenario 3: Married User without Spouse Linked ‚úì
1. Login as married user without spouse_id
2. Navigate to IHT Planning
3. **Expected:**
   - Spouse exemption notice with link to profile
   - Missing data alert shows "spouse_account"
   - Limited functionality message

#### Scenario 4: Non-Married User ‚úì
1. Login as single/widowed user
2. Navigate to IHT Planning
3. **Expected:**
   - Standard IHT calculation (existing behavior)
   - No spouse-specific components
   - No errors

### Step 5: Component Testing Checklist

- [ ] SpouseExemptionNotice renders correctly
- [ ] Links in SpouseExemptionNotice work
- [ ] MissingDataAlert shows when data missing
- [ ] DualGiftingTimeline charts render (ApexCharts)
- [ ] Gifting timeline empty states work
- [ ] IHTMitigationStrategies accordion expands/collapses
- [ ] All strategy types render correctly
- [ ] LifeCoverRecommendations tabs switch properly
- [ ] Self-insurance pros/cons visible
- [ ] Comparison table accurate
- [ ] All currency formatting correct (¬£)
- [ ] All date formatting correct (UK format)

### Step 6: API Testing

Test the endpoint directly:
```bash
# Get auth token
TOKEN=$(mysql -u root -se "SELECT token FROM laravel.personal_access_tokens WHERE tokenable_id = 1 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1")

# Call endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/estate/calculate-second-death-iht-planning \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq
```

**Expected Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "show_spouse_exemption_notice": true,
  "spouse_exemption_message": "string",
  "data_sharing_enabled": boolean,
  "second_death_analysis": { ... },
  "gifting_strategy": { ... },
  "life_cover_recommendations": { ... },
  "mitigation_strategies": [ ... ],
  "user_gifting_timeline": { ... },
  "spouse_gifting_timeline": { ... }
}
```

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

1. **ApexCharts not loading**: Ensure ApexCharts is installed: `npm install apexcharts vue-apexcharts`
2. **Auth state access**: Verify `this.$store.state.auth.user` path is correct
3. **Router links**: Ensure `/profile` and `/settings` routes exist
4. **Date parsing**: Watch for timezone issues with gift dates
5. **Currency formatting**: Ensure all values are numbers, not strings

---

## üìä Performance Considerations

- Second death calculation is computationally intensive (combine estates, project forward, calculate IHT)
- Consider adding loading indicators for long calculations
- Cache results in Vuex to avoid recalculation on component remounts
- Monitor API response times (should be < 2 seconds)

---

## üé® Design Consistency

All components follow FPS design system:
- Tailwind CSS classes
- Consistent color scheme (green=good, amber=warning, red=critical, blue=info, purple=secondary)
- Rounded corners (rounded-lg)
- Border styles consistent
- Font sizes consistent (text-sm, text-xs, text-lg)
- Spacing consistent (p-4, mb-6, space-y-3)

---

## üìù Code Quality

- All components use Vue.js 3 Composition API patterns
- Props validated with types
- Methods clearly named
- Comments added where needed
- Error handling implemented
- Loading states handled
- Empty states handled
- Follows existing component patterns

---

## üîí Security Considerations

- All API calls require Sanctum authentication
- Users can only access their own data
- Spouse data requires explicit permission
- No sensitive data exposed in URLs
- CSRF protection via Sanctum

---

## üìö Documentation

- **IHTtasks.md**: Detailed implementation plan with all tasks
- **IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md**: This file - completion summary
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated with second death IHT planning features (to be done)
- **API docs**: To be created in docs/API_SECOND_DEATH_IHT.md
