## Phase Execution Strategy

### ✅ Wave 1: Can Start Immediately (Post Phase 1)

These phases depend only on Phase 1 (Database Schema) and can be started in parallel:

#### **Phase 2: User Profile Restructuring** [IN PROGRESS]
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1 only
- **Status:** 40% complete (Backend done)
- **Can run parallel with:** Phase 3, Phase 8
- **Blocking:** Phase 7 (needs user profile link in header)

#### **Phase 3: Net Worth Dashboard**
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1, Phase 2 (partial - assets summary)
- **Status:** Not started
- **Can run parallel with:** Phase 2 (backend complete → Phase 3 can start), Phase 8
- **Blocking:** Phase 4, Phase 6, Phase 7
- **Note:** Can start once Phase 2 backend is complete (already done)

#### **Phase 8: Admin Roles & RBAC**
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1 only
- **Status:** Not started
- **Can run parallel with:** Phase 2, Phase 3
- **Blocking:** Phase 7 (needs admin middleware for UK Taxes card)
- **Duration:** Only 20 hours - quick win

---

### ⚠️ Wave 2: Requires Net Worth Complete

These phases depend on Phase 3 (Net Worth Dashboard) being complete:

#### **Phase 4: Property Module**
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1, Phase 3
- **Status:** Not started
- **Can run parallel with:** Phase 6 (if started after Phase 3)
- **Blocking:** Phase 5, Phase 6 (partial), Phase 7
- **Note:** Must wait for Phase 3 Net Worth service

#### **Phase 6: Trusts Dashboard**
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1, Phase 3, Phase 4
- **Status:** Not started
- **Can run parallel with:** Phase 4 (partially - needs asset structure from Phase 3)
- **Blocking:** Phase 7
- **Note:** Needs Net Worth asset aggregation pattern from Phase 3

---

### 🔗 Wave 3: Integration Phases (Sequential)

These phases require multiple previous phases and must be done sequentially:

#### **Phase 5: Actions/Recommendations Card**
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1-4
- **Status:** Not started
- **Must be sequential:** YES - needs recommendations from all modules
- **Blocking:** Phase 7
- **Note:** Aggregates outputs from Protection, Retirement, Estate, Property modules

#### **Phase 7: Dashboard Reordering & Card Updates**
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1-6
- **Status:** Not started
- **Must be sequential:** YES - final UI arrangement
- **Blocking:** Phase 9
- **Note:** Reorders cards created in Phases 2-6

---

### 🚀 Wave 4: Finalization (Sequential)

These phases must be done at the end:

#### **Phase 9: Data Migration**
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1-8
- **Status:** Not started
- **Must be sequential:** YES - migrates existing data to new structure
- **Blocking:** Phase 10
- **Critical:** Requires all new tables/structures from Phases 1-8
- **Risk:** High - data integrity critical

#### **Phase 10: Testing & Documentation**
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1-9
- **Status:** Not started
- **Must be sequential:** YES - final validation
- **Blocking:** Production deployment
- **Note:** Tests entire restructured system

## Recommended Execution Timeline

### **Current State (Week 4)**
✅ Phase 1: Complete
🟡 Phase 2: 40% Complete (Backend done, Frontend in progress)

### **Week 4-5: Parallel Execution Block A**
Run these 3 phases **in parallel**:

1. **Complete Phase 2** (Frontend: 48 hours remaining)
   - UserProfile.vue + 5 tab components
   - Vuex store + router updates
   - Testing

2. **Start Phase 3** (80 hours)
   - Can start NOW - Phase 2 backend complete
   - NetWorthService + Controller
   - Frontend components + charts
   - Testing

3. **Start Phase 8** (20 hours - QUICK WIN)
   - Admin RBAC middleware
   - Role checks in frontend
   - Testing
   - **Completes first** → unblocks admin features

**Team allocation:** 2-3 developers can work on these simultaneously

---

### **Week 6-7: Parallel Execution Block B**
Run these 2 phases **in parallel** (after Phase 3 complete):

1. **Phase 4: Property Module** (80 hours)
   - Requires: Phase 3 complete
   - Property CRUD + tax calculators
   - SDLT/CGT calculations
   - Integration with Net Worth

2. **Phase 6: Trusts Dashboard** (40 hours)
   - Requires: Phase 3 complete
   - Trust asset aggregation
   - IHT periodic charge calculations
   - Integration with Estate module

**Team allocation:** 2 developers work in parallel

---

### **Week 8-9: Sequential Integration**

**Phase 5: Actions/Recommendations** (40 hours)
- **Must be sequential** - depends on Phases 1-4
- Aggregates recommendations from all modules
- Cannot start until Property module complete
- Single developer can handle this

---

### **Week 10: Final UI Assembly**

**Phase 7: Dashboard Reordering** (20 hours)
- **Must be sequential** - depends on Phases 1-6
- Rearranges all cards in final order
- Updates Retirement/Estate card displays
- Quick phase - single developer

---

### **Week 11-12: Data Migration**

**Phase 9: Data Migration** (40 hours)
- **Must be sequential** - depends on Phases 1-8
- **CRITICAL PHASE** - no parallel work
- Migrates Estate assets → new structure
- Migrates savings_accounts → cash_accounts
- **High risk** - requires full team attention
- Includes rollback planning + testing

---

### **Week 13: Final Validation**

**Phase 10: Testing & Documentation** (40 hours)
- **Must be sequential** - depends on Phases 1-9
- Comprehensive integration testing
- UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
- API documentation updates
- User guide creation
- Final deployment preparation

## Parallelization Summary

### ✅ **Can Be Done in Parallel**

| Phase Group | Phases | Timing | Dependencies Met |
|-------------|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Block A** | 2, 3, 8 | Week 4-5 | Phase 1 complete ✅ |
| **Block B** | 4, 6 | Week 6-7 | Phase 3 complete |

**Maximum parallelization:** 3 phases at once (Phases 2, 3, 8)

---

### ⛔ **Must Be Done Sequentially**

| Phase | Why Sequential | Blocks |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Phase 5** | Needs recommendations from Phases 1-4 | Phase 7 |
| **Phase 7** | Final UI assembly of components from Phases 2-6 | Phase 9 |
| **Phase 9** | Data migration - needs all new structures from Phases 1-8 | Phase 10 |
| **Phase 10** | Final testing - validates entire system | Deployment |

---

## Risk Assessment

### **Low Risk Parallel Phases**
- ✅ Phases 2, 8 (independent components)
- ✅ Phases 4, 6 (after Phase 3, minimal overlap)

### **Medium Risk Parallel Phases**
- ⚠️ Phases 2, 3 (Phase 3 needs Phase 2 assets summary - but backend complete)

### **High Risk Sequential Phases**
- 🔴 Phase 9 (Data Migration) - MUST be sequential, high data integrity risk
- 🔴 Phase 10 (Testing) - MUST validate complete system

---

## Critical Path Analysis

The **critical path** (longest sequence that cannot be parallelized):

```
Phase 1 (Complete)
  → Phase 3 (80h)
  → Phase 4 (80h)
  → Phase 5 (40h)
  → Phase 7 (20h)
  → Phase 9 (40h)
  → Phase 10 (40h)

Total Critical Path: 300 hours (7.5 weeks at 40h/week)
```

**With parallelization:**

```
Phase 1 (Complete)
  → Block A: max(Phase 2: 48h, Phase 3: 80h, Phase 8: 20h) = 80h
  → Block B: max(Phase 4: 80h, Phase 6: 40h) = 80h
  → Phase 5: 40h
  → Phase 7: 20h
  → Phase 9: 40h
  → Phase 10: 40h

Total Optimized Path: 300 hours (7.5 weeks)
```

**Time savings with parallelization:** Minimal on critical path, but allows:
- Phase 2 completion without delaying Phase 3
- Phase 8 (admin) as early quick win
- Phase 6 (Trusts) completion during Phase 4

---

## Team Resource Allocation

### **Optimal Team Size: 2-3 Developers**

#### **Week 4-5 (Block A): 3 Developers**
- Developer 1: Complete Phase 2 Frontend (48h)
- Developer 2: Phase 3 Backend + Frontend (80h)
- Developer 3: Phase 8 RBAC (20h) → then assist Phase 3 (60h)

#### **Week 6-7 (Block B): 2 Developers**
- Developer 1: Phase 4 Property Module (80h)
- Developer 2: Phase 6 Trusts Dashboard (40h) → then assist Phase 4 (40h)

#### **Week 8-9: 1 Developer**
- Developer 1: Phase 5 Actions/Recommendations (40h)

#### **Week 10: 1 Developer**
- Developer 1: Phase 7 Dashboard Reordering (20h)

#### **Week 11-12: Full Team (ALL HANDS)**
- **All developers:** Phase 9 Data Migration (40h)
- **Critical phase:** No parallel work, full team focus

#### **Week 13: Full Team**
- **All developers:** Phase 10 Testing & Documentation (40h)
