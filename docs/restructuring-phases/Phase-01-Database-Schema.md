## Success Criteria

- [x] All 12 database migrations created
- [x] All migrations run successfully without errors (batch [2])
- [x] 8 new models completed with relationships (Household, FamilyMember, Property, Mortgage, BusinessInterest, Chattel, CashAccount, PersonalAccount)
- [x] 3 existing models updated (User, InvestmentAccount, Trust)
- [x] All foreign key constraints in place
- [x] All indexes created
- [x] Test seeders create valid data (2 households, 3 users, 1 admin)
- [x] Basic architecture tests pass (7/7 tests passing)
- [x] No rollback errors when testing migrations
- [x] 8 model factories created
- [x] Phase 1 documentation updated with all completed tasks

---

## Dependencies

None - This is the foundation phase

---

## Blocks

This phase blocks:
- Phase 2 (User Profile Restructuring) - needs User model updates
- Phase 3 (Net Worth Dashboard) - needs all asset models
- Phase 4 (Property Module) - needs Property and Mortgage models
- Phase 6 (Trusts Dashboard) - needs Trust model updates

---

## Notes

- Keep old `assets` and `savings_accounts` tables until Phase 9 (Data Migration)
- Test each model individually before proceeding
- Ensure all decimal fields use correct precision (15,2 for currency)
- All ownership_percentage fields should be 5,2 (e.g., 100.00, 50.00)
- Document any deviations from original plan

---

## Next Steps

After Phase 1 completion:
1. Review all models and relationships
2. Run comprehensive tests
3. Proceed to Phase 2: User Profile Restructuring
