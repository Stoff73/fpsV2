## Key Decisions & Changes

Document any significant decisions or deviations from the plan here:

- *2025-10-17:* Phase 1 started and completed in 6 hours
  - All 12 migrations created and run successfully (batch [2])
  - All 11 models (8 new + 3 updated) completed with relationships
  - Test seeders created (HouseholdSeeder, TestUsersSeeder, AdminUserSeeder)

## Notes

- Each phase document contains detailed checklists - check off items as you complete them
- Some tasks can be parallelized (e.g., frontend and backend work)
- Testing tasks are integrated into each phase (don't defer testing to Phase 10)
- Cache invalidation is critical for Phase 3 - test thoroughly
- Keep Phase 9 (Data Migration) simple - focus on data integrity over feature additions
