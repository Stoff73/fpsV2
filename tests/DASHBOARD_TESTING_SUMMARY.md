### Key Test Scenarios

✅ **Component Rendering**
- All components render correctly with proper data
- Props are passed correctly to child components
- Empty states are handled appropriately

✅ **Calculations & Logic**
- Net worth = Total assets - Liabilities
- Composite score = Weighted sum of module scores
- ISA allowance = £20,000 - (Cash ISA + S&S ISA)
- Percentage calculations are accurate

✅ **User Interactions**
- Button clicks trigger correct actions
- Navigation works to all modules
- Dismiss functionality works for alerts
- Refresh button reloads data

✅ **Loading & Error States**
- Skeleton loaders display during data fetch
- Error cards appear when API fails
- Retry buttons reload failed modules
- Parallel loading with Promise.allSettled

✅ **Edge Cases**
- Zero values handled gracefully
- Negative net worth displays correctly
- Over-limit ISA subscriptions show warnings
- Missing data defaults to safe values

**Location**: `/tests/Feature/Dashboard/`
**Framework**: Pest (PHPUnit)
**Total Tests**: 23

### Test File

**DashboardApiTest.php**
- File: `/tests/Feature/Dashboard/DashboardApiTest.php`
- Endpoints: 5 API endpoints tested
- Coverage: Authentication, data structure, caching, error handling

### Endpoints Tested

1. **GET /api/dashboard**
   - ✅ Requires authentication
   - ✅ Returns aggregated data from all 5 modules
   - ✅ Caches data for 5 minutes
   - ✅ Handles errors gracefully

2. **GET /api/dashboard/financial-health-score**
   - ✅ Requires authentication
   - ✅ Returns composite score and breakdown
   - ✅ Includes weighted calculations
   - ✅ Caches data for 1 hour
   - ✅ Labels and recommendations are contextual

3. **GET /api/dashboard/alerts**
   - ✅ Requires authentication
   - ✅ Returns prioritized alerts from all modules
   - ✅ Alerts are sorted by severity
   - ✅ Includes module information
   - ✅ Caches data for 15 minutes

4. **POST /api/dashboard/alerts/{id}/dismiss**
   - ✅ Requires authentication
   - ✅ Invalidates alerts cache

5. **POST /api/dashboard/invalidate-cache**
   - ✅ Requires authentication
   - ✅ Clears all dashboard caches
   - ✅ User-specific cache keys

### Key Test Scenarios

✅ **Authentication & Authorization**
- All endpoints require `auth:sanctum` middleware
- Unauthenticated requests return 401
- Users can only access their own data

✅ **Data Structure & Validation**
- Response JSON structure is correct
- All required fields are present
- Data types are correct

✅ **Caching Strategy**
- Dashboard data: 5 minutes TTL
- Financial health score: 1 hour TTL
- Alerts: 15 minutes TTL
- User-specific cache keys
- Cache invalidation works

✅ **Business Logic**
- Weights sum to 1.0 (100%)
- Score labels match score ranges
- Alerts are sorted by severity
- Different users have separate caches

- Correct weights: Protection 20%, Emergency Fund 15%, Retirement 25%, Investment 20%, Estate 20%

✅ **Score Labels & Recommendations**
- "Excellent" for scores 80-100
- "Good" for scores 60-79
- "Fair" for scores 40-59
- "Needs Improvement" for scores 0-39
- Recommendations are contextual

✅ **Alerts**
- Alerts aggregated from all modules
- Sorted by severity (critical > important > info)
- Each alert has required fields
- Severity values are valid

✅ **Caching Workflows**
- Data is fetched and cached correctly
- Cache invalidation clears all caches
- Parallel data loading handles partial failures
