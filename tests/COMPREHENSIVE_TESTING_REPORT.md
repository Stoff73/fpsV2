## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Protection Module - Critical Illness Policy 422 Error ✅

**File**: `resources/js/components/Protection/PolicyFormModal.vue`

**Problem**: API returned 422 Unprocessable Entity when adding Critical Illness policies

**Root Cause**: Form was setting `policy_type = 'term'` for both Life Insurance and Critical Illness policies, but backend expects `['standalone', 'accelerated', 'additional']` for critical illness.

**Solution**: Separated logic for life insurance and critical illness policies at lines 382-394.

---

### 2. Estate Module - Cash Flow Tab Infinite Loop ✅

**Files Modified**:
- `resources/js/views/Estate/EstateDashboard.vue`
- `resources/js/components/Estate/CashFlow.vue`

**Problem**: Cash Flow tab hung indefinitely, causing infinite API requests and 429 rate limit errors.

**Root Cause**: EstateDashboard was using global `loading` state with `v-if/v-else`, which destroyed/recreated the CashFlow component on every loading state change, triggering `mounted()` again in an infinite loop.

**Solution**:
1. Created local `initialLoading` state in EstateDashboard (line 149)
2. Added component-level loading guards in CashFlow (lines 192-193, 242-244)

---

### 3. Estate Module - Liability Form Missing Columns ✅

**Files Modified**:
- `database/migrations/2025_10_15_094650_add_additional_fields_to_liabilities_table.php` (NEW)
- `app/Models/Estate/Liability.php`

**Problem**: Liability form fields were being silently ignored when saving.

**Root Causes**:
1. Database missing 5 columns: `secured_against`, `is_priority_debt`, `mortgage_type`, `fixed_until`, `notes`
2. Enum mismatch: migration had 4 liability types, form expected 9
3. Model `$fillable` array incomplete

**Solution**:
1. Created migration to add missing columns and update enum
2. Updated model fillable array and casts
3. Migration successfully applied

---

### 4-6. Verification of Previously Fixed Issues ✅

**R-1: DC Pension Annual Salary** - Verified working correctly
**E-2: IHT RNRB Taper** - Verified implemented in `IHTCalculator.php` lines 91-105
**I-1: Monte Carlo Polling** - Verified implemented in `poller.js` lines 123-137
